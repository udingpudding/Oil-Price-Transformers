Communique of the African Petroleum Producers’ Organization (APPO).
41st Ordinary Session of the Council of Ministers.
Council of Ministers of APPO on 14 December 2021 in Algiers, Algeria.
The Council of Ministers of the African Petroleum Producers’ Organization (APPO) just ended its 41st Ministerial Session with a resolve to continue the exploitation of its Member Countries’ huge oil and gas resources for the economic emancipation of its people while also exploring the use of renewable energies.
The Session which was presided by the President of the Organization, His Excellency Mohamed Arkab, Minister of Mines and Energy of the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, was attended by the Ministers and Heads of Delegation of the 14 Member Countries of the Organization, namely Algeria, Angola, Benin, Cameroun, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Libya, Niger, Nigeria and South Africa. Also, in attendance were Ministers of Petroleum and Energies of Senegal, H.E. Aishatou Sophie Gladima, the deputy Minister of Energy of Ghana, His Excellency Mohamed Amin Adam, the Executive Secretary of the Africa Energy Commission of the African Union, Mr. Rashid Ali Abdalla and the Executive Chairman of the Africa Energy Chamber, Mr. NJ Ayuk, among other international energy organizations.
Top on the agenda of the Ministerial discussions was the Future of the Oil and Gas industry in Africa in the light of the Global pursuit of Energy Transition. Ministers acknowledged the reality of climate change and expressed their support for any human efforts aimed at tackling the dangers of climate change. The Session noted that the current approach to energy transition is unilateral imposition where the developed countries that have for over one hundred years used fossil fuels to grow their economies and societies and have all along been aware of the dangers of fossil fuel emissions, are now telling the world that fossil fuels are dangerous to mankind and that all should abandon it.
The Ministers noted that this aggressive drive for Energy Transition is coming at a time that African economies are poised to launch themselves into industrialization, which requires a lot of energy, whereas the economies of the developed countries now require less energy because of their transformation from manufacturing to knowledge production and artificial intelligence. 
The Ministers identified the imminent challenges that the oil and gas industry will face in Africa as international financiers withdraw funding for the industry, and oil and gas research institutions in the developed countries that have always led the technological development are closing their petroleum faculties. On financing energy projects on the Continent, the Council resolved to look within the continent at both public and private sources to raise the necessary capital to continue to finance the oil and gas industry. They agreed that Africa needs to re-strategize as the game is fast changing. Africa shall need to look within for the expertise, technology, finance and markets for its energy resources. The Council noted that the potential exists, as Africa has a huge population of 1.3 billion people. All they need is to be mobilized and empowered to be able to buy energy.
The Council reaffirmed its commitment to the protection of the environment, emphasizing the need to pursue technologies that would allow for the use of fossil fuels with minimum carbon footprints.  Furthermore the Council called on the technologically advance and financially capable countries to lend their support to African countries as they grapple with the challenges of Energy Transition. Council noted the need for intra-African energy infrastructure like cross-border pipelines, products depots and terminals.
The Council welcomed on board five new Ministers, H.E. Bruno Jean-Richard Itoua of Congo, H.E. Budimbu Ntubuanga Didier of DR Congo, H.E. Thomas Camara of Cote d’Ivoire, H.E. Mohamed Oun of the State of Libya and H.E. Mahammane Sani Mahammadou of Niger.
The Council of Ministers unanimously elected H.E. Mr. Diamantino Pedro Azevedo and H.E. Mr. Samou Seidou Adambi, Minister of Petroleum Resources of Angola and Minister of Water and Mines of Benin, respectively, as APPO President and Vice President for the year 2022
Finally, the Council of Ministers approved Mr. Celestin Enanto, Executive Board Member for Benin and Mr. Jean Jacques Koum, Executive Board Member for Cameroon, respectively as Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Executive Board for the year 2022.
The next Ordinary Session of the Ministerial Council will be held in Angola during the last quarter of 2022 at a date to be communicated by the host country.

2021-12-10,"The Declaration of Cooperation of OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries reaches five years
No 37/2021
Vienna, Austria
10 Dec 2021
The Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) between OPEC Member Countries and 10 non-OPEC oil-producing countries turned five today, 10 December 2021.
On this day in 2016, OPEC Member Countries and Azerbaijan, the Kingdom of Bahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Equatorial Guinea (which later joined OPEC), Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Sultanate of Oman, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan gathered in Vienna, Austria, at the OPEC Headquarters to embark on a new era of cooperation to support sustainable stability in the global oil market. Other producers attended the meeting in support of these extraordinary efforts.
The birth of the DoC built on the successful ‘Algiers Accord’, signed in Algiers, Algeria, on 28 September 2016 at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference and the subsequent ‘Vienna Agreement’, decided on 30 November of the same year in Vienna, Austria, at the 171st Meeting of the OPEC Conference.
OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, stated: “The Declaration of Cooperation is an unprecedented collaborative framework of leading oil producers that saw the need to come together during a critical juncture in the global oil industry. If it was not for this group of countries and the courageous act that they have undertaken, the oil sector would, without a doubt, be in a different situation.
“Looking back to 2016, very few believed that the collaborative efforts would grow and evolve into a major, robust cooperative force to help restore much needed stability in the global oil market. However, the 23 oil-producing countries have continued to rise to the challenges they have encountered, including instrumenting effective and visionary policies to combat the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The inaugural OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting saw participating countries take several decisions in view of oil market conditions and prospects in the short and medium terms, as well as in recognition of the need for joint cooperation by oil producers to achieve sustainable oil market stability in the interest of producers, consumers, investors and the global economy. It also recalled the rights of peoples and nations to permanent sovereignty over their natural wealth and resources.
Non-OPEC participants adopted a voluntary downward production adjustment, supporting OPEC’s decision of the 171st Meeting of the OPEC Conference. Additionally, three non-OPEC countries joined the high-level ministerial monitoring committee established through the ‘Vienna Agreement’, which is mandated to review the decisions’ successful implementation. The Ministers also highlighted the importance of strengthening cooperation at the technical level.
In response to the severe oil market contraction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the DoC’s 23 countries adopted the largest-in-size and longest-in-time voluntary oil production adjustment in the history of OPEC and the oil industry, demonstrating their continued commitment to a stable oil market.
These efforts have supported the global pandemic recovery process, and were recognized at the highest levels of government and by other international organizations and academia."

2021-12-01,"Opening address to the 182nd Meeting of the OPEC Conference
No 35/2021
Vienna, Austria
01 Dec 2021
Delivered by HE Dr Diamantino Pedro Azevedo, Angola’s Minister of Mineral Resources and Petroleum and President of the OPEC Conference, at the 182nd Meeting of the OPEC Conference, 1 December 2021, via videoconference.
Your Royal Highness, esteemed colleagues,
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the 182nd Meeting of the OPEC Conference.
Let me begin by thanking the OPEC Secretariat for the consistent quality and timeliness of the research, analysis and other services they provide to our Member Countries, and for the outstanding technical support that makes our meetings possible.
We are aware that Austria is experiencing a serious new wave of COVID-19, with lockdown measures in place, and we wish the Secretariat Staff and their families safety and good health during these very challenging times.
The Secretariat has remained operational throughout multiple lockdowns over the past 20 months and has never missed a beat in supporting our Member Countries, and many other important stakeholders, with excellent reports and industry-leading publications.
Esteemed colleagues,
Five years ago, the 171st Meeting of this Conference gave its unanimous support to joining with ten non-OPEC oil-producing countries in the Declaration of Cooperation – one of the boldest experiments in the 150-year history of oil.
The Declaration was the crowning achievement of efforts that began in September 2016 with the ‘Algiers Accord’ to develop a framework for consultations with leading non-OPEC producers.  This visionary decision was followed two months later by the ‘Vienna Agreement’, which in turn paved the way for the signing of the Declaration of Cooperation in Vienna on December 10, 2016.  This series of events marked a new chapter in the history of the oil industry.
Not all of us were present at these meetings.  But all of us here today are witnesses to the astonishing success of this unique framework.  Together, we set in motion two of the industry’s greatest market stabilization efforts, first to address the supply-driven downturn in 2015 and 2016, and then the demand crash at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic – a downturn with no precedent in modern times.
Over the past 20 months, this trusted and proven relationship has worked without pause to stimulate and accelerate market stability and balance … and to support the global economy through lockdowns, ups and downs, and long periods of uncertainty.
Today, the COVID-19 pandemic remains a persistent foe which continues to spook the markets.  The sudden appearance of a potentially new and more dangerous variant comes on top of new lockdowns in parts of Europe aimed at reversing a dramatic infection surge, especially in unvaccinated populations.
On another front, the planned release of oil from a number of strategic reserves reinforces to the necessity of diligent market monitoring to avoid a return to market imbalance.  And we need to pay close attention to downside risks associated with inflation spikes, rising debt levels and supply-chain disruptions.
In these uncertain times, it is imperative that we – together with the non-OPEC countries in the DoC – remain prudent in our approach and prepared to be proactive as market conditions warrant. 
We need to remain united, focused and ready to adapt to any changing market dynamics, as we have always done in the five-year history of the DoC, to ensure market balance, a sustainable stability, and to support growth and investments in the months and years ahead.
When OPEC reached out to non-OPEC in 2016, we were told it was an exercise in futility.  This was proven wrong, not just once, but time and time again, to the benefit of producers, consumers and the global economy.
The five-year anniversary is one we should all applaud, thanking the OPEC Secretariat, the JTC, the JMMC, all Participating Countries, and each and every individual that has contributed to our success over the past half a decade.
The crucial role we have played in the recovery process is indeed reflected in the Economic Commission Board’s latest assessment, which expects global economic growth of around 5.6% this year and 4.2% in 2022.  Our think-tank sees oil demand growing by around 5.7 mb/d in 2021 and a further 4.2 mb/d in 2022, which puts us on track to exceed levels not seen since early 2020. 
Throughout all our efforts, we have benefited enormously from the leadership of HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman as Chair of both the OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings and the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee.  With Alexander Novak, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, as co-Chair, they have kept us moving in the direction of recovery and stability.
Esteemed colleagues,
Today, we have the opportunity to consider the updated OPEC Long-Term Strategy.  This timely document sets OPEC’s priorities and directions to help achieve the visionary aims set out by the Founder Members in 1960.  It is important to remember here that since its founding, our Organization has overcome seven major oil cycles, and has emerged stronger each time.
I want to thank the High-Level Working Group and the OPEC Secretariat for carrying out a bottom-up review of the Strategy.
Thanks to their hard work, the draft Strategy presents a complete picture of the main challenges; scenarios and sensitivity cases; elements and actions; and recommendations on how to achieve our objectives.
The document also reflects the major changes in the five years since the last review was approved by the Conference, especially developments related to energy and climate policies, tougher investment conditions, and technology trends.
Some of the identified challenges have come into sharper focus during the pandemic.  One example is the stimulus funding of around $25 trillion provided by developed countries and financial institutions during the pandemic, including massive sums aimed at incentivizing low-carbon economies.
The discussions leading up to and dominating the UN climate negotiations in Glasgow last month further amplified the challenges and uncertainties facing our industry.
The potential adverse economic impacts on our Member Countries could be very significant.  Yet we remain firmly committed to global cooperation on climate issues, and dedicated to finding inclusive solutions to support post-pandemic social and economic resilience.
With global primary energy demand expected to increase by 28% by 2045, this is no time to create energy pariahs, nor to side-line leading energy-exporting countries like ours.
Our world also has an obligation to help many millions of people in Africa and other developing regions who live in energy poverty.  Complex and interconnected challenges like climate change and energy poverty call for comprehensive and sustainable solutions to ensure an equitable distribution of energy.  No one should be left behind.
I am very pleased by the Long-Term Strategy’s strong focus on collaboration to identify and support inclusive climate and energy policies.  It is of utmost importance that we build on the successes of the Declaration of Cooperation and other collaborative platforms, such as the Charter of Cooperation.
Allow me to also underscore the major contributions of OPEC’s Energy Dialogues with other producing countries, leading consumer nations and key institutions.  These regular forums further contribute to the common goal of sustaining market stability.
Since the last OPEC Conference, high-level and technical meetings have taken place with the Russian Federation and India, both long-time Dialogue partners.  The Gas Exporting Countries Forum is an important newcomer to these forums, and many of our Member Countries are GECF Members or Observers.
In two days, on December 3rd, the fifth OPEC-China Energy Dialogue will take place, providing an important and timely platform for discussion with one of the world’s leading energy-consuming nations.  Furthermore, our extensive cooperation with the International Energy Forum and other key institutions underpin our efforts to share knowledge and expand data access.  All these dialogues and exchanges are appreciated and valued by our bilateral partners.
Before we turn to our busy agenda, I would also like to pay tribute to our esteemed colleague HE Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismaael, Iraq’s Minister of Oil, and to his Government for the extraordinary efforts that have gone into planning for a well-deserved celebration of OPEC’s 60th Anniversary.  Though delayed by pandemic-related travel restrictions, we look forward to commemorating the anniversary in the birthplace of our Organization, Baghdad, in the first quarter of 2022.
It is with great sadness that the last surviving delegate at the founding of OPEC on September 14, 1960, Abdullah Ismail, passed away recently.  This distinguished veteran of the oil industry in two Member Countries, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, will be sorely missed at the celebration.
In closing, it has been an honour for me, and for Angola, to hold the Presidency of the OPEC Conference during this history-making year.
I thank all my esteemed colleagues and the OPEC Secretariat for the outstanding support you have provided.
Thank you, and I look forward to another successful meeting of the OPEC Conference."

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) today marks the 5th anniversary of the historic ‘Vienna Agreement’ reached at the 171st Meeting of the OPEC Conference held on 30 November 2016 in Vienna, Austria.
The milestone meeting built on the successful ‘Algiers Accord’, reached in Algiers, Algeria, on 28 September 2016 at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference and paved the way for the historic Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) between OPEC Member Countries and leading non-OPEC oil producing nations to work together in the interest of sustainable oil market stability.
The Conference saw OPEC Member Countries reinforce their joint efforts to overcome a then-unprecedented oil market downturn, reduce inventory overhang, particularly in the OECD region, and revive the necessary investment to support energy security and market stability in the short, medium and long terms.
In recalling the momentous meeting, OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, stated: “The volatility seen in the oil market in 2016 was unprecedented for many; however, there was a strong consensus that the way forward requires collaboration, leadership and extensive diplomacy – some of the key characteristics that have underpinned the Organization’s work since its founding 61 years ago.
“The ‘Vienna Agreement’ constitutes an historic moment in the history of the oil industry, as well as in international cooperation and multilateralism, as it led to the institutionalization of a global framework that not only helped the oil industry immediately, but also years later when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020 and caused a severe oil market contraction.”
Five years ago, on the last day of November, OPEC Members called on non-OPEC oil-producing nations to join an initiative to cooperate on a regular basis to support oil market stability, highlighting the key role that non-OPEC producers can play in achieving this all-important objective. They additionally adopted oil production adjustments and established a high-level ministerial monitoring committee to review the implementation of these decisions.
These efforts were carried out to help restore stability in the global oil market for the benefit of all producers, consumers and investors, as well as the global economy. They additionally underpinned the Organization’s views on the importance of multilateralism, international cooperation and dialogue."

Vienna, Austria
29 Oct 2021
[Joint Conclusion] The 5th High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-India Energy Dialogue was held on 29 October 2021 via videoconference. The Meeting was co-chaired by H.E. Hardeep Singh Puri, India’s Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs, and H.E. Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, Secretary General of OPEC.
The meeting focused on the impact of COVID-19 on global energy markets, and its potential ongoing implications in the coming years; the post-COVID energy recovery in India, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges; the overall energy market outlook in the medium and long terms; oil supply security issues; impact of high energy prices; and the roles of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC), the Charter of Cooperation (CoC) and the measures being taken to maintain oil market stability.
H.E. Puri began highlighting that the year 2021 marks the fifth Anniversary of the India- OPEC Energy Dialogue. Over the years, cooperation between India and OPEC has intensified across a range of fronts, particularly on the technical level.
H.E. Puri raised the issue of energy market volatility, current high energy prices and in that context underlined the importance of seeking market stability for the benefit of producers and consumers. He also addressed the issue of price differentials between different regions.
The Honourable Minister emphasized India’s commitment to eradicate energy poverty. The core of Indian government policy is to provide equitable access to clean, affordable and sustainable energy to all Indians. He added that India would continue to develop all possible energy sources, while being fully cognizant of the sustainability dimensions of it.
The Honourable Minister noted that OPEC provides 71% of crude oil, 58% of LPG, 33% of LNG and 45% of petroleum products demand of the country.
H.E. Puri shared that India has shown great resilience in its energy system with its petroleum products demand recovered, reaching and surpassing pre-COVID-19 levels. This has been aided by India’s vaccination drive, noting that it is the largest and fastest free vaccination drive in the world and crossed the milestone of 1 billion vaccines in the previous week.
The OPEC Secretary General said that the strategic dialogue with India has many strands to it that underscored the ever-evolving nature of our cooperation. He noted that “last week I had the pleasure to partake in the India Energy Forum by CERA Week, which included a session with His Excellency, the Honourable Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. Our cooperation and dialogue reaches the very highest of levels.”
He also underscored that positive relationship between OPEC and the CEOs and high-level management of major Indian oil companies, the various technical meetings, the OPEC Secretariat hosting a number of interns from India, and this year’s contribution from India of a standalone chapter on the country’s energy outlook in OPEC’s World Oil Outlook 2021. 
H.E. Barkindo also noted that India’s support for the producer-consumer dialogue has greatly contributed to the Organization’s success in pursuing the sustainability of the oil market in recent years, which has been on display during the unprecedented challenges as result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
He stated that OPEC and the DoC countries remain proactive, flexible and vigilant in its goal of a balanced and stable market, and highlighted the importance of the regular monthly meetings. He added: “As always, we remain open, transparent and ready to engage on how we all move forward together.” In this regard, he stated that “there is no substitute to international dialogue and working together as the most effective means of acting in the best interests of consumers, producers and the global economy.”
It was noted that much has already been accomplished within the framework of the dialogue, including exchanges of knowledge and technical meetings, and OPEC looks forward to this continuing and deepening in the future. India was invited to join the Charter of Cooperation as a producer and major oil consumer, to benefit from exchanges on pertinent issues affecting the oil market.
Prior to the High-Level Meeting, experts from OPEC and India held their regular technical meeting to discuss matters of common interest and importance in the energy sphere, along with future potential activities.
The next High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-India Dialogue will be held in 2022 at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna."

[Joint Communique] The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) held the Second High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-GECF Energy Dialogue, hosted by the GECF, on 27 October 2021, via videoconference.
The Meeting was co-chaired by HE Yury Sentyurin, GECF Secretary General, and HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General. It noted the importance of crude oil and natural gas to the global economy and in meeting current and future energy demand, highlighting that both commodities will account for around half of the total global energy mix in the decades ahead.
“Together, OPEC and GECF can count on their respective competencies to ensure that the global economy heals after the devastation of coronavirus and that a reliable and secure energy supply serves humanity like never before,” said HE Yury Sentryurin in his opening address.
“Notwithstanding the prevalent reductionism and the cancel culture, the GECF, together with stakeholders like OPEC, aspires to present a balanced energy-transition roadmap to the international community for a constructive and informative debate. The GECF-OPEC relationship in fact demonstrates the power of constructive debate to unlock the full potential of the world’s energy system.”
In his remarks, the OPEC Secretary General highlighted the importance of the ongoing dialogue with the GECF, noting that it is crucial for the organizations of two vital energy sources to regularly cooperate and exchange views on pressing issues in the interest of global energy stability and sustainability.
“The bonds that bring our Organizations together run far deeper than the geology that has linked oil and gas since the beginning of time,” OPEC Secretary General stated, adding, “Today, it is of utmost importance that Organizations like OPEC and the GECF continue to work hand-in-hand to ensure that we remain in a strong position to provide secure, stable and sustainable supplies of energy.”
The Secretary Generals shared a statement that oil and gas have an important role to play in the energy transition and support the need to reduce emissions, bolster efficiency and embrace innovation. It is therefore important to be aware of the risks of not adequately investing in the future of the oil and gas industries.
In implementing the Memorandum of Understanding signed on 3 October 2019 in Moscow, the Russian Federation, the two intergovernmental organizations have been increasingly improving the accuracy of dataflow and analysis, strengthening the exchange of information and expertise, which dates back to mutual cooperation on JODI (Joint Organisations Data Initiative).
Both organisations now contribute to each other’s flagship publications — the World Oil Outlook and Global Gas Outlook 2050 — on a reciprocal basis. From 2022 onwards this practise is to be expanded to short- and medium- analysis of the global oil and gas markets’ development.
The Meeting examined the latest figures and estimates from OPEC and GECF’s perspectives, reviewed the outcomes of the key international debates on future of energy and environment, such as the G20 Environment, Climate and Energy Ministerial Meeting, UN High-Level Dialogue on Energy, Middle East Green Initiative Summit, as well as topics related to the upcoming UNFCCC COP26 meeting.
Apart from representing interests in two of the world’s most sought-after fuels, OPEC and GECF share several Member Countries: Algeria, Equatorial Guinea, IR Iran, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela. OPEC Member Countries Angola, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates are GECF Observers. The discussion acknowledged a possibility of stronger cooperation with some non-OPEC countries participating in the Declaration and Charter of Cooperation that are GECF Members or Observers.
The Secretaries General recalled recent bilateral engagements, including meetings on the sidelines of the inauguration ceremony of HE Ebrahim Raisi, the new President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in Tehran this August, as well as at the Russian Energy Week in Moscow earlier this month.
The leaders agreed to hold the next High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-GECF Energy Dialogue in 2022 in Vienna, Austria.

Background:
The GECF and OPEC signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 30 October 2019, to “exchange knowledge, experience, views, information, data and practices in the areas of mutual interest.” Areas of cooperation identified in the memorandum include energy market monitoring, analysis, modelling and forecasting; energy market research studies covering the short- medium- and long-term, and their methodologies; energy market data and statistics, data and statistical operational topics (such as methodologies of data gathering, assessment and dissemination); energy initiatives and developments aimed at sustainability, along with environmental and social responsibility; and other areas and matters involving common interests and concerns.

21 Oct 2021
[Joint Press Release] The International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Energy Forum (IEF) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) met today via videoconference for the 8th Joint IEA-IEF-OPEC Workshop on the Interactions between Physical and Financial Energy Markets.
The high-level Workshop was co-chaired by OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, together with Mr. Joseph McMonigle, Secretary General of the IEF, and Keisuke Sadamori, Director of the Office for Energy Markets and Security at the IEA. The Workshop had over 110 participants.
In his opening remarks, HE Barkindo said “It is exactly these types of close collaboration that we will need to see more of in the weeks and months ahead as this industry continues to rise to the challenge of adapting to the paradigm shifts that are currently taking place.”
The Secretary General reminded participants that there was but a little over a week until the highly anticipated United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow and that investment would be one of the deciding issues for the industry in the years ahead. He added that “oil and gas will continue to play an important role in world energy supply on the medium to long term” and that “Meeting these rising energy requirements will be dependent on a steady flow of industry investment”, which would also be “essential to advancing innovation and technology that will be instrumental in further improving the environmental footprint and reducing emissions”.
Mr. McMonigle raised concerns with respect to energy investment, noting that global demand is rebounding after the COVID-19 pandemic but private sector investment has yet to respond adequately. This could lead to price fluctuations that will impact market stability, and derail a sustainable and inclusive recovery from the pandemic, he noted. Complex physical and financial energy market dynamics are better understood, better regulated, and more transparent since the three organisations launched the dialogue in response to the Global Financial Crisis more than a decade ago. The discussions of the trilateral work programme today have offered greater insight into market dynamics and will help producers and consumers assess if more concerted action is warranted, he added.
Mr. Sadamori stressed that the world is not investing enough to meet its future energy needs. Transition-related spending has gradually picked-up, but remains far short of what is required to meet rising demand for energy services in a sustainable way. The amount currently spent on oil appears to be geared towards a world of stagnant or falling demand. A surge in spending on clean energy transitions provides the way forward, but this needs to happen quickly or global energy markets are likely to be volatile for years to come.
Sadamori added that “an effective and orderly transition will be critical – not only to reach international climate targets but also to prevent serious supply disruptions and destabilising price volatility along the way”.
Discussions during the videoconference were structured into two sessions, focusing on financial markets, investment and the impact of the drive in ESG on the upstream oil industry.
The first session covered ‘Investment opportunities in the oil industry in light of recent trends in the global economy and financial markets’, which provided an overview of how investors across different asset classes are approaching investing in energy and how that translates into the outlook for oil markets. The second session delved further into the ‘Impact of the accelerated drive towards ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) on investment in E&P activity’.
The Joint Workshop is one part of the trilateral work programme established by the three organizations and endorsed by energy ministers at the 12th International Energy Forum in Cancún, Mexico, in March 2010.  Since then, the joint IEA-IEF-OPEC meetings covering the evolving inter-linkages between physical and financial energy markets have developed into a unique, high-level dialogue event that brings together a diverse range of market participants to discuss issues that are not addressed in other high-level fora. To encourage open and informative discussion, the Workshop was held under Chatham House Rule.
In conclusion, the three organizers thanked all the participants for their committed and forthright discussions on these crucial and timely issues, and looked forward to convening the next Joint Workshop in 2022."

OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, participated in two key panel discussions during the 2021 edition of Russian Energy Week (REW) in Moscow.
The Secretary General took part in sessions on ‘The Future of Traditional Energy: Is the World Ready to Eschew Hydrocarbons’ and ‘International Energy Organization Dialogue: Predicting the Development of Energy and Global Markets’.
At the first panel session, the Secretary General, along with HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman, Minister of Energy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; HE Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure of the United Arab Emirates; HE Alexander Novak, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation; HE Parviz Shahbazov, Minister of Energy of the Republic of Azerbaijan; Alexander Dyukov, Chairman of the Management Board and Chief Executive Officer of Gazprom Neft; Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF); and Robert Dudley, Chairman of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, debated the outlook for energy. It was moderated by Ryan Chilcote.
During the discussion, the Secretary General thanked the Russian Federation for hosting REW, highlighting the significance and timeliness of organizing such a forum.
In reference to the upcoming COP26 meeting, he underscored the importance of the UN conference, which will be held in Glasgow between 31 October and 12 November. He urged all stakeholders to focus on developing fair, comprehensive and inclusive solutions to address climate change.
The Secretary General also stressed the need to use COP26 as a platform to build global consensus. He said that OPEC and its Member Countries fully subscribe to the Paris Agreement, noting that all 13 Members have signed the accord and are working towards achieving its goals.
He also noted the importance of securing funding, as provided by under the 2015 Paris Agreement, to assist developing countries in their efforts to adopt adaption and mitigation efforts towards climate change.
“What the world will look forward to in Glasgow is a comprehensive, all-inclusive agreement that will bring both developed and developing countries parties on the same page, so that we can achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement,” the Secretary General told the panel.
Prince Abdul Aziz took the opportunity to praise the efforts of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) participants. He also recalled the outcomes of the recent OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings, including the voluntary upward production adjustment decided on at the 21st Meeting held on 4 October.
The Minister highlighted the importance of cooperation and dialogue in the energy markets. He also underscored the need to address climate change and energy poverty, noting that diverse energy sources are needed to tackle the later.
At the session, Minister Al Mazrouei recognized the positive role of the DoC in supporting oil market stability, stating, “The DoC has done a great job.”
The UAE Minister also emphasized the important role of investment. He additionally outlined the UAE’s energy strategy to 2030, which harnesses various energy sources, such as gas, solar and nuclear. He also underlined hydrogen’s important future role.
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister noted that when the REW was held two years ago, no one could foresee the pandemic and its major impact on energy markets.
Novak continued by highlighting the ongoing recovery in the oil and gas sectors, adding that improving demand growth is evident. He stressed that the DoC participating countries have brought a very positive impact to the global oil market.
At a later session, the Secretary General discussed OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook (WOO), whose 15th edition was published on 28 September.
In his remarks, the Secretary General stressed that all forms of energy will be needed in the decades ahead to address the world’s growing economy and expanding population. In the period to 2045, the WOO 2021 sees global energy demand expanding by 28 per cent.
“It’s a no-brainer that we are going to need more energy to meeting growing demand,” Barkindo said.
“The projections show that nearly all sources of energy will grow over the next quarter of a century, led by renewables, which will rise from a global fuel share of around 2 per cent in 2020 to over 10 per cent by 2045,” he stated, adding, “Oil is expected to continue to take leading position in addressing the world’s energy needs for the foreseeable future.”
“Incremental demand by 2026 will be nearly 14 mb/d higher than in 2020, and total demand is expected to be just over 108 mb/d by 2045. Oil and gas together will provide nearly 53 per cent of the world’s energy needs in 2045 – a little over 28 per cent for oil and 24 per cent for gas,” he said in his remarks.
“As an African, I know very well that we need to harness all the energy resources at our disposal, from the sun over our heads to the abundant fuels that lie beneath our feet, if we are to ease energy poverty and develop our continent’s economies.”
HE Yury Sentyurin, Secretary General of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), participated in the ‘International Energy Organization Dialogue’ session, along with other senior officials and industry experts.
The REW is taking place between 13-15 October 2021."

No 31/2021
Vienna, Austria
11 Oct 2021
The OPEC Secretariat today hosted the First Technical Workshop with Energy Companies via videoconference.
The Workshop constitutes the Organization’s latest outreach initiative to promote dialogue and international cooperation in support of its overarching objective of fostering a sustainable stability in the global oil market. The event serves as a dynamic platform for national and international oil companies to discuss issues of mutual interest and exchange outlooks on the energy markets.
OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, opened the meeting by highlighting the importance and timeliness of the workshop, stating, “This inaugural event signifies a new milestone in OPEC’s ongoing outreach efforts and builds on our long tradition of promoting partnerships with a wide range of industry stakeholders, including public and private sector organizations and corporations.”
“OPEC has a long, historical connection to its Member Country national oil companies, and, more recently, we have intensified our efforts to hold informal meetings and exchange information with international oil companies,” Barkindo added.
The Secretary General continued by underscoring the significant role that oil and gas are expected to play globally in the years ahead.
Referencing OPEC’s World Oil Outlook 2021, HE Barkindo noted that primary energy demand is projected to increase by 28 per cent in the period to 2045, and thus all forms of energy, including oil and gas, will be required to meet these rising requirements.
The Secretary General also emphasized the critical issue of long-term industry investment and its impact on the sustainability of the industry.
“We estimate that cumulative oil-related investment requirements will total approximately $11.8 trillion from 2021 to 2045,” he noted, adding, “We could see a supply shortfall and the potential for unwanted volatility and risks to energy security” if these requirements are not met.
In reference to the climate change issue and the upcoming COP26 Conference, the Secretary General underlined the need to adopt an inclusive, fair and balanced approach when addressing the energy transition. “Let me make it clear that OPEC supports the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, bolster innovation and enhance efficiency,” he stated. “However, this cannot come at the cost of depleting industry investment. The fact remains: the world needs energy, energy requires investment and investment relies on companies.”
In its first iteration, the Workshop attracted more than 100 participants, including national oil company delegates from both OPEC Member Countries and non-OPEC countries participating in the Charter of Cooperation, in addition to participants from international oil companies, as well as industry experts and analysts.
Presentations and discussions centred on a number of key issues relevant to the energy sector, including perspectives of national and international oil companies on the role of petroleum in the energy transition, efforts to bolster carbon capture projects, opportunities and challenges associated with the rapidly changing industry dynamics, as well as topics related to COP26 scheduled for 31 October to 12 November in Glasgow."

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) today launched the 2021 edition of its Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB), via videoconference.
The launch was attended by HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General; Professor Thomas Lindner of the Executive Academy at the Vienna University of Economics and Business; as well as Members of Management at the Secretariat. It was livestreamed via the Organization’s website and official YouTube account.
In its 56th edition, the ASB continues to provide a wide range of data on the global oil and gas industry, in addition to key economic indicators, serving as a leading industry reference for reliable and timely information for various industry stakeholders, including policymakers, academics and industry analysts. The publication contains time-series data detailing key aspects of the petroleum industry, such as production, demand, imports, exports, exploration, transportation and refining.
It also features key statistics on the oil and gas activities in OPEC’s 13 Member Countries: Algeria, Angola, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, IR Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.
In line with the Secretariat’s efforts to enhance access to the publication, this year’s ASB is available as an interactive version and a PDF on the OPEC website, as well as through a smart app compatible with iOS and Android platforms.
In his remarks, the Secretary General emphasized the crucial importance of data accuracy and transparency to supporting stability in the global oil market.
“We at OPEC are dedicated to enhancing data transparency through broad dissemination of accurate and timely oil and gas data, not only for the ASB, but for all of our publications,” he stated. “Indeed, maintaining transparency in all that we do underpins our core goal of establishing sustainable oil market stability.”
The opening remarks were followed by a panel discussion led by Ms. Boshra AlSeiari, Head of OPEC’s Data Services Department, focusing on the publication’s key highlights, including:
Total world crude oil production declined in 2020 by 6.15 million barrels per day (mb/d), or 8.2 per cent, as compared to 2019, to average 69.09 mb/d, marking a historical year-on-year drop notably after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. OPEC crude oil production declined sharply year-on-year by 3.72 mb/d, or 12.7 per cent, while crude production by non-OPEC countries fell by 2.43 mb/d, or 5.3 per cent.
With an average of 90.73 mb/d in 2020, world oil demand was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and fell by a historic 9.30 mb/d y-o-y. OECD oil demand fell sharply in 2020, while in the non-OECD it declined for the first year in history. Oil demand in OPEC Member Countries was sluggish in 2020, losing 8.2 per cent y-o-y. Distillates and gasoline accounted for around 55.1 per cent of 2020 world oil demand with a steep downward trend, amid COVID-19 containment measures. Residual fuel oil requirements were about 7.1 per cent of total oil demand in 2020.
OPEC Member Countries exported an average of 19.70 mb/d of crude oil in 2020, a sharp decrease of about 2.78 mb/d, or 12.4 per cent, compared to 2019 and marking the fourth consecutive annual decline. Following the pattern in previous years, the bulk of crude oil from OPEC Member Countries – 14.43 mb/d or 73.2 per cent – was exported to Asia, particularly China and India. Considerable volumes of crude oil – about 3.13 mb/d – were also exported to OECD Europe in 2020, which, however, represents a decline compared with 3.74 mb/d recorded in 2019. OECD Americas imported 0.84 mb/d of crude oil from OPEC Member Countries, which was about 0.38 mb/d, or 31.1 per cent, less than the 2019 volumes.
Exports of petroleum products from OPEC Member Countries averaged 3.48 mb/d during 2020, down by around 0.40 mb/d, or 10.4 per cent, compared to 2019. Imports of petroleum products by OPEC Member Countries averaged at 1.52 mb/d in 2020, roughly 0.17 mb/d, or 9.8 per cent, lower than in 2019.
World proven crude oil reserves stood at 1,549 billion barrels at the end of 2020, increasing by 0.2 per cent from the level of 1,546 billion barrels recorded at the end of 2019. Proven crude oil reserves in OPEC Member Countries increased by 0.3 per cent to 1,237 billion barrels at the end of 2020, following a firm increase during 2019.
At the end of 2020, world proven natural gas reserves fell by 0.4 per cent to approximately 206.7 trillion standard cubic metres (cu m). Proven natural gas reserves in OPEC Member Countries stood at 73.74 tr standard cu m at the end of 2020, down 1.4 per cent from the level at the end of 2019.
World refinery capacity shrank by 0.3 m barrels/calendar day (b/cd) to stand at 101.1 m b/cd during 2020. The non-OECD region, particularly China, other Asia and the Middle East, recorded refining capacity additions. Refinery capacity in the OECD declined sharply in 2020, as compared to 2019. Globally, refinery throughput fell by a historic 9.1 per cent to reach 78.0 mb/d in 2020, amid bearish oil demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The OPEC Reference Basket averaged $41.47/b in nominal terms during 2020, down from $64.04/b in 2019, a strong decrease of $22.57/b, or 35.2 per cent. The volatility level was $12.55/b, or 30.3 per cent, relative to the yearly average.
A Q&A session with attending journalists and analysts was held after the panel discussion. A special video highlighting the ASB’s key findings was also screened during the launch.

2021-09-28,"OPEC's World Oil Outlook 2021 launched in Vienna
No 28/2021
Vienna, Austria
28 Sep 2021
The 2021 OPEC World Oil Outlook (WOO) was launched today in Vienna, Austria. The 15th edition of the WOO presents an in-depth review of the OPEC Secretariat’s ongoing analysis of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and contains medium- and long-term projections for the global oil and energy industry.
This includes analysis of the industry’s various linkages and its shifting dynamics, providing insights into energy and oil demand, oil supply and refining, the global economy, policy and technology developments, demographic trends, environmental issues and sustainable development concerns.
In the foreword to the publication, His Excellency Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General said that the past year has been one of continuing uncertainty related to the pandemic, but noted the benefits of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) production adjustments in bringing down inventory levels, and the market being buoyed by the rollout of vaccines and further global fiscal stimulus.
He also personally thanked OPEC Secretariat staff for the hard work, drive and steadfastness of all those that have been involved in producing the WOO. “For the second year it has not been an easy task, given the restrictions on office-based working, but I salute each and every one of you for your dedication and commitment to delivering this flagship annual publication.”
It is important to reiterate that the Outlook is not about making predictions. The WOO should be viewed as a helpful and insightful reference tool, one that underscores the Organization’s commitment to knowledge sharing and data transparency. It also emphasizes OPEC’s continued focus on the enhancement of dialogue and cooperation, most recently through the historic DoC and the Charter of Cooperation between 23 OPEC and non-OPEC producers, as a means to help secure a sound and stable oil industry.

The WOO 2021 can also be accessed on two digital interfaces, the OPEC WOO App available for both Android and iOS, and a comprehensive interactive version, which can be accessed at woo.opec.org
Some specific highlights from this year’s WOO include:
The year 2020 saw the largest ever global drop in energy and oil demand, but 2021 has witnessed a significant rebound as vaccines were rolled out, lockdowns were eased, mobility increased, economies opened up further, and fiscal and infrastructure packages were implemented.
Total primary energy demand is set to expand by a robust 28% in the period to 2045.
All forms of energy will be needed to support the post-pandemic recovery in a sustainable way, balancing the needs of people in relation to their social welfare, the economy and the environment.
‘Other renewables’  – combining mainly solar, wind and geothermal energy – see the largest growth in both absolute and percentage terms, leading to a share over 10% by 2045. Gas witnesses the second largest increase in absolute terms.
Oil is expected to retain the largest share of the energy mix throughout the outlook period, accounting for just over a 28% share in 2045.
All major fuel types witness growth, with the exception of coal.
Global oil demand is forecast to reach 108.2 mb/d by 2045, from a low of 90.6 mb/d witnessed in 2020.
The non-OECD drives oil demand with growth of 25.5 mb/d by 2045 (compared to 2020), whereas the OECD region is expected to contract by 7.9 mb/d.
India is expected to be the largest contributor to incremental demand, adding 6.5 mb/d between 2020 and 2045.
Oil demand in road transportation will continue to dominate the sectoral breakdown, increasing by 6.3 mb/d over the forecast period, with the total vehicle fleet (passenger and commercial vehicles) set to expand by over 1.1 billion by 2045 to around 2.6 billion.
The long-term share of alternative fueled vehicles in the total fleet is projected to reach a level of around 24% in 2045, but conventional vehicles remain dominant.
Oil demand in the aviation sector was most affected by COVID-19 restrictions in relative terms, but it is projected to recover in the long term with an expected expansion of 5.8 mb/d out to 2045.
Non-OPEC liquids supply is expected to continue its recovery and grow by 7.5 mb/d from its 2020 low to 70.4 mb/d in 2026, driven by US tight oil, as well as barrels from Brazil, Russia, Guyana, Canada and Kazakhstan.
After US supply peaks at 20.5 mb/d around 2030, total non-OPEC liquids supply is also expected to decline, reaching 65.5 mb/d in 2045.
OPEC liquids, which recover to pre-pandemic levels by around mid-decade, rise strongly thereafter, reaching nearly 43 mb/d in 2045. In terms of market share, this implies an increase from 33% in 2020 to 39% by 2045.
Estimated refining capacity additions in the medium-term are a robust 6.9 mb/d, while another 7.1 mb/d of incremental capacity is required in the long-term, predominantly in developing countries.
Refinery capacity closures of 4.5 mb/d between 2020 and 2026, mostly in developed countries, will help to balance out the downstream market in the medium-term.
After the 2020 drop, global inter-regional crude and condensate trade is projected to recover and reach levels above 38 mb/d in 2025, and increase further to above 40 mb/d from 2035 onwards.
The Asia-Pacific region is the main outlet for crude and condensate imports, increasing from 23.5 mb/d in 2019 to almost 30 mb/d in 2045. The Middle East remains the largest supplier to this region, increasing exports by 4.8 mb/d over this period.  
Cumulative oil-related investment requirements amount to $11.8 trillion in the 2021-2045 period. Of this, 80%, or $9.2 trillion is in the upstream, with another $1.5 and $1.1 trillion needed in the downstream and midstream, respectively. 
The pandemic has affected United Nations climate change and sustainable development processes, with implications for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda.
Enhanced global cooperation could allow for a more coherent, balanced and integrated approach for realizing the Paris Agreement and interlinked Sustainable Development Goals.
Technological advancements are set to shape the global energy landscape and the world needs to look for cleaner and more efficient technological solutions everywhere, across all available energies.
Uncertainties related to the outlook for oil demand and supply are abundant, and will need to be closely monitored.

No 25/2021
Vienna, Austria
14 Sep 2021
OPEC takes pride in honouring and celebrating its rich and unique history and heritage, particularly on the Anniversary of its founding on 14 September 1960. The year 2021 marks the 61st Anniversary of that auspicious day and represents an opportunity to reflect on the Organization’s past and look to the future.
Between 10 and 14 of September 1960, representatives from five oil producing countries descended on Al-Shaab Hall in the Bab Al-Muaatham district in Baghdad: Fuad Rouhani of Iran; Dr. Tala’at al-Shaibani of Iraq; Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait; Abdullah Al-Tariki of Saudi Arabia; and Dr. Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo of Venezuela. As a result of the actions of these five founding fathers, OPEC came into existence. 
Looking back, it may appear that the Organization’s formation was inevitable. However, each of the Organization’s Founder Members arrived in Baghdad with different objectives, expectations and priorities. Yet, they recognized that common interests outweighed any differences they may have had; that working together will always yield greater results than going it alone and unity is a source of strength.
This spirit has infused every chapter of OPEC’s history. The founding of the Organization is a consequence of cooperation, dialogue and compromise; and this has been clearly apparent in our consensus approach and every success OPEC has enjoyed in the subsequent 61 years.
The spirit of Baghdad has most recently manifested in the collective efforts of OPEC’s Member Countries and 10 non-OPEC oil producing countries to respond to the severe oil demand contraction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Inspired by the founding vision that undergirds OPEC, the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process has been pivotal in the recovery in global oil markets over the past 18 months.
In reflecting on the Organization’s Anniversary, OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo said: “The world has changed in unimaginable ways since 1960. The challenges our Member Countries faced in 1960 are very different to those of today. However, throughout all the seismic events of the last sixty-one years, OPEC’s commitment to international cooperation, dialogue and taking responsible action in the interests of oil producers, consumers and the global economy has been unwavering. This ‘OPEC Day’, we take time to pause and give thanks for the tireless dedication of generations of Heads of State and Government, Ministers, Governors and other high-level experts from outside the Secretariat and, from within the Secretariat, Secretaries General, Management and Staff of every relevant discipline, all of whom have played a critical role in the Organization’s successes.”
Sixty one years on, OPEC remains focused on a balanced and stable oil market, promoting dialogue among all stakeholders in the energy industry, particularly through the ‘Declaration’ and ‘Charter of Cooperation’, and contributing to the search for options and solutions to some of the major challenges facing humankind, such as climate, sustainable development and energy poverty alleviation."

No 19/2021
Abuja, Nigeria
06 Jul 2021
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) took part in the 20th edition of the Nigeria Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition.
At the Opening Ceremony, OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, delivered a keynote address on the theme: ‘Global oil market dynamics in a decarbonizing world’.
The Secretary General, in his recorded remarks as Honourary Conference Chairman, thanked the leadership of Nigeria for its unwavering commitment and continuous support of OPEC over its five-decades of Membership. He lauded Nigeria’s contributions to promoting sustainable stability in the global oil market and its influential role in the OPEC and non-OPEC Declaration of Cooperation (DoC).
“OPEC is deeply indebted to HE Muhammadu Buhari, President of Nigeria, for the leading role he has played and continues to play in support of the Declaration of Cooperation process. This historic achievement has ushered in a new era in global energy cooperation,” Barkindo stated.
He added: “Over the last five decades, OPEC and Nigeria have sown the seeds of friendship to build a highly fruitful and mutually beneficial relationship, forging strong ties that will last forever.” In underscoring Nigeria’s contribution to the Organization, he noted that over its 50 years of Membership, the country has provided OPEC with 23 Heads of Delegation, six of whom served as President of the Conference. Nigeria has also proffered the Organization with four Secretaries General.
Barkindo stressed the importance of the event, which he noted has risen in stature over the years to become a leading industry event. He also recalled the two industry pioneers whose visionary leadership were responsible for its founding – Dr. Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria and Dr. Alirio Parra of Venezuela.
On the Conference’s theme, the Secretary General pointed out that all forms of energy will be required to meet current and future energy demands, and that recent calls for oil and gas industry divestment are irresponsible and unrealistic.
In this context, the Secretary General underlined the key role of innovation, technology and science in the energy industry, which has resulted in cutting-edge solutions such as carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), as well as hydrogen. These will be viable options for reducing the global carbon footprint, he added.
On energy poverty, Barkindo underscored the need to ensure energy access for all around the world as part of a fair, inclusive and equitable energy transition.
The Secretary General stated OPEC’s intention to return to its birthplace in Baghdad, Iraq, in September of this year to celebrate the Organization’s Diamond Anniversary. This landmark occasion will celebrate OPEC’s six decades of supporting stability in the global oil market, in the interest of consumers, producers and the global economy.
The OPEC Secretariat takes part in this leading energy event on an annual basis. This year’s edition saw the Secretariat participating through hosting a booth, where the Organization’s history and achievements were presented, along with its flagship publications, the World Oil Outlook, the Annual Statistical Bulletin and the OPEC Bulletin.
Nigeria will mark its 50 years of Membership in OPEC on 12 July. For this special occasion, the OPEC Secretariat has produced a special issue of the OPEC Bulletin, which takes a retrospective look at Nigeria’s journey as an OPEC Member from 1971 until today. The Secretariat has also produced a documentary film to mark the occasion."

Delivered by HE Dr Diamantino Pedro Azevedo, Angola’s Minister of Mineral Resources and Petroleum and President of the OPEC Conference, at the 181st Meeting of the OPEC Conference, 1 July 2021, via videoconference.
Your Royal Highness, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the 181st Meeting of the OPEC Conference.
I would like to begin by congratulating our esteemed colleague, His Excellency Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, who will be taking a bow from his post as Minister of Petroleum for the Islamic Republic of Iran.  You have provided noble leadership, wise counsel and technical knowledge to the OPEC Conference for many years, and have been instrumental in our Organization’s many achievements.
OPEC has also benefited immensely from your leadership and vital contributions to the Declaration of Cooperation from the very beginning in 2016, and notably in April 2020 when the Participating Countries reacted decisively to the global collapse of oil demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  As the longest serving OPEC Minister, your wisdom and experience will be deeply missed.  It has been an immense pleasure to work with you, and I wish you and your family good fortune in the years to come.
Also at this time, I would like to welcome His Excellency Dr Mohammad Abdullatif Alfares, the Minister of Oil and Minister of Higher Education of Kuwait, and His Excellency Bruno Jean Richard Itoua, Congo's new Minister of Hydrocarbons, to their first meetings of the Conference.  We wish both of you great success and look forward to our work together.  On behalf of all of OPEC, I thank your predecessors for their contributions to the Conference and tireless work on behalf of the Organization.
Allow me to also use this opportunity to congratulate our esteemed colleague, His Excellency Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, on the occasion of Nigeria’s upcoming 50th anniversary as an OPEC Member Country.
This golden milestone provides an opportunity to reflect upon Nigeria’s rise as a global energy supplier and partner; its pivotal support for oil market stability; and its contributions to expanding OPEC’s cooperation with other producing and consuming countries.
I wish you a Happy Golden Anniversary!
The celebration of another milestone is in the works – the 60th anniversary of OPEC, which was postponed last year due to the pandemic.  I thank His Excellency Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismaael and the Government of Iraq for all the planning that has gone into the commemoration on September 30th in the Organization’s birthplace – Baghdad.  By waiting an extra year, we are looking even younger and more fit!  The OPEC Secretariat is working closely with the Organizing Committee in Baghdad to midwife a befitting celebration.
Excellencies, distinguished delegates,
I am in the very fortunate position of opening this meeting of the OPEC Conference today at a time of rising hope and optimism.
In the seven months since the last OPEC Conference, the global economy has shifted from reverse to forward gear.  Global growth is now expected at 5.5% this year – from a contraction of 3.4% in 2020.
The outlook for worldwide oil demand is also moving in the right direction, and is now on course to grow by 6 mb/d in 2021, after its turbulent 9.3 mb/d decline last year.  The latest OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report projects a strong rebound of oil demand in the second half of the year, putting us within striking distance of pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter.
The story of this improving market outlook would not be complete without recognizing the leading role played by the Declaration of Cooperation.
Today begins the third month of the step-by-step upward production adjustments the Participating Countries agreed to undertake at the start of April.  The market continues to welcome these prudent and forward-looking steps to support sustainable stability, which in turn provide crucial backing for the economic recovery.  We will continue to remain proactive and vigilant in our actions on the back of our commitments and the success of the widely acclaimed Declaration of Cooperation.
I would also point out the important role the oil industry plays in ensuring the distribution of vaccines by supplying fuel needed for transportation.  Additionally, many of the medical supplies and protective clothing, as well as equipment essential in the fight against COVID-19, are produced using petroleum-based products.
Throughout our efforts to provide the world with a secure and stable oil supply, we have benefited from the leadership of HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Energy, as Chair of both the OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings and the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee.  Together with the Co-Chair, Alexander Novak, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, they have guided us through one of the most difficult chapters in the oil industry’s history.  We look forward to the continued leadership of this ‘dream team’.
I would also like to underscore the importance of Saudi Arabia’s additional voluntary adjustments, including those in February, March and April, which have reinforced and reaffirmed our overall efforts to keep the market on the road to recovery.  Equally important, these generous contributions provided a window of opportunity for Participating Countries that needed extra time to make up for overproduction.
Looking beyond the two-year duration of our April 2020 production adjustment roadmap, it will be important to carry on with the Declaration of Cooperation and our diligent monitoring efforts to avoid any potential for a large supply overhang developing in 2022.
Allow me to also thank our tireless Secretary General and the staff of the OPEC Secretariat.  Mr Secretary General, you kept our ship on course as we navigated the stormy seas of 2020, and you continue to keep us headed in the direction of recovery.  The staff deserve special recognition for the consistent quality and timeliness of the research, analysis and other services you provide to Member Countries. 
Altogether, the herculean efforts of the past 15 months have contributed enormously to the Organization’s reputation as a strong and trusted partner.  Indeed, our contributions to sustainable oil market stability have been recognized repeatedly from the highest policymaking levels; from the executive suites of leading international oil companies; by consuming nations; and by numerous other energy stakeholders.
Excellencies, distinguished delegates,
We have experienced many false dawns during this pandemic, and though we meet today at a time of rising hope and optimism, this is no time to lower our guard.
The coronavirus continues to take a painful toll, with thousands of lives still being lost every day.  The presence of the new Delta variant and the recent surge in case numbers in India, along with other Asian countries, Latin America, the UK and most recently Russia and Africa, are a grim reminder of the uncertainties that still loom over us.
The pandemic is not the only concern flashing on our radar screen.  The record levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus that have helped shore up economies and drive the recovery come with heavy baggage – high debt levels and the potential for inflationary spikes that could in turn erode progress in the oil market.  It is important to remember that many countries do not have the financial firepower to stimulate growth.  They will continue to need international support so that the recovery is both durable and global.  
Looking further down the road, we face uncertainties arising from policy measures, investor activism, and litigation that could have a detrimental impact on the ability of our industry to invest in production, technology and human capacity.  These potentially exclusionary policy and investment actions – which are mostly being shaped by some developed countries – risk not only our oil and gas industries, but the ability of our Member Countries to achieve their social and economic development ambitions.
Another issue of utmost concern is energy poverty, which disproportionately affects many countries here in Africa.  Our continent needs continued access to our valuable indigenous energy resources, including oil, to keep pace with current needs while closing the gulf that separates the energy haves and have-nots.  The coronavirus is a vivid reminder that energy access must remain at the top of the agenda during the climate deliberations later this year in Glasgow.
In closing, I would like to turn back the pages of time to the 176th OPEC Conference and the 6th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting.
Two years ago, on July the 2nd 2019, we unanimously endorsed the Charter of Cooperation along with our Declaration of Cooperation partners.  In total, delegations from more than 30 oil-producing countries gathered at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna for that historic event.  Today, the Charter stands out as an example of our Organization’s forward-looking leadership and the timeless importance of dialogue, cooperation and respect among all nations.
Under the umbrella of the Charter of Cooperation, the OPEC Secretariat is preparing the First Ministerial Roundtable on Energy, Climate and Sustainable Development for oil-producing countries, which is scheduled to take place on September 6th.  In preparation for the Ministerial Roundtable, OPEC is organizing the 4th Technical Workshop and the 19th Coordination Meeting on Climate Change, both of which are taking place next week.
Thank you, and I look forward to another successful meeting of the OPEC Conference."

The OPEC Secretariat will mark the 50th anniversary of Nigeria joining the Organization on July 12, 2021. Nigeria was unanimously accepted as the then 11th Member of OPEC on July 12, 1971, it was a day of historic importance for both Nigeria and OPEC.
To commemorate this landmark date, the OPEC Secretariat has pieced together a special OPEC Bulletin. The edition will look at the history of Nigeria’s relationship with OPEC, including the many giants of Nigerian public service who have been responsible for the successful five-decade relationship that has evolved with OPEC, interview high-level figures, and examine and explore other topical issues surrounding Nigeria.
The focal interview is with the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari, an OPEC veteran for over 40 years. President Buhari has been heavily involved in the Organization’s affairs and is currently the only serving Head of State in the world who made his career by being intensely involved in the OPEC family.
OPEC Secretary General, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, said: “OPEC has been fortunate to benefit from the talent, wisdom and extraordinary capabilities of generations of Nigerian public servants. They have been integral to what the Organization has achieved. Over the course of the five decades of OPEC Membership, Nigeria has been a constructive partner, seeking consensus, and always encouraging compromise. The special OPEC Bulletin highlights all of this.”
Barkindo added: “The unique relationship between OPEC and Nigeria has been mutually beneficial and laden with a plethora of successes. The Golden Anniversary of Nigeria’s Membership is indeed a cause for celebration. I very much hope that all Nigerians will celebrate with us, not only reflecting on the past, but also considering how we can build a more prosperous future together.”
The OPEC Secretary General will also deliver a keynote address to the 20th Nigeria Oil and Gas Conference that takes place from July 5-8, which will make reference to the positivity and longevity of the relationship between Nigeria and OPEC."

OPEC, in collaboration with the African Energy Commission (AFREC), the African Petroleum Producers’ Organization (APPO) and African Refiners and Distributors Association (ARDA), joined efforts during the inaugural OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue to promote continent-wide energy cooperation initiatives.
The High-Level meeting culminates more than two years of work to expand dialogue, technical cooperation and enhanced research on the continent’s promising energy future. The videoconference built upon previous technical meetings with AFREC and APPO.
In his opening remarks at the ground-breaking event, OPEC Secretary General, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, noted that OPEC has a long history of prioritizing cooperation through dialogues with a number of oil-producing and consuming countries, as well as with international organizations and global corporations.
“These events have proven to be highly effective in promoting mutual understanding on key energy issues, while also enhancing our common efforts as energy stakeholders to tackle industry challenges, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic,” the Secretary General said.
In addition to the OPEC Secretary General, speakers at the inaugural event were Rashid Ali Abdallah, Executive Director of AFREC; Dr Omar Farouk Ibrahim, Secretary General of APPO; and Anibor Kragha, Executive Secretary of ARDA.
In his remarks, Mr Rashid Ali Abdallah of AFREC stressed that to maximise local added value of the whole oil chain in Africa, “we should explore the relevance of investment in refining facilities and increase cross-boarder trading, especially through the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). These dialogues are therefore key to strengthening our relations, help facilitate the mobilisation of Africa’s own energy resources and potentials, continue to bring energy to the top of national and regional agendas, whilst taking approaches that put Africa directly on to innovative and low carbon energy development pathways.”
In his keynote address, Dr Omar Farouk Ibrahim of APPO expressed the need “to join efforts to tackle the daunting challenges facing the global energy sector, and particularly Africa, which informed the decision of the APPO Ministerial Council to conduct a ‘Study on the Future of the Oil and Gas Industry in Africa’ in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and COP21.” The APPO Executive Director also stressed the necessity to undertake cross-border and regional energy projects in the context of energy transition.
Mr Anibor Kragha of ARDA noted that the “First OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue was very timely, especially in harnessing Africa’s contributions to the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November. Our positive deliberations on promoting sustainable investments across Africa’s oil and gas industry, developing a robust energy transition roadmap and securing the required funding to execute crucial regional projects will usher in a new era of prosperity for the continent.” He added: “ARDA, along with AFREC and APPO, is fully committed to this laudable OPEC initiative and that it will ultimately ensure that Africa’s full energy potential is realized and our citizens’ future energy demands are met with cleaner petroleum products, especially low-sulphur fuels and LPG for clean cooking in the near-term.”
The objective of the dialogue is to bring together top energy policymakers from various energy institutions to provide support and policy guidance to the technical meetings of the energy dialogue, aimed at enhancing cooperation and collaboration in energy data acquisition and joint studies, with a view to optimize their limited resources in pursuit of wider objectives. In particular, the mutual goals of the organizations are based extensively on energy access and energy poverty alleviation in Africa.
The OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue will provide critical input for identifying enablers for investment in the African energy sector, accessibility and affordability of energy to eradicate energy poverty, and discuss the future of oil and energy in the post-COVID-19 recovery and energy transition for Africa.
The African continent is set to become increasingly important in terms of global energy demand and supply. African countries are projected to provide the largest share of world population growth in the long term and the continent will experience a significant expansion in urbanization levels. These underlying demographics, coupled with a growing economy and rising income levels, will drive an increase in energy demand.
Key points highlighted during the first High-Level OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue included:
Energy poverty remains a major challenge that requires expanded cooperation to achieve solutions;
All sources of energy are needed to meet anticipated energy demand as well as expand energy access;
Expanded cross-border energy trade and connections could strengthen energy access and reliability;
A sustainable finance plan for African energy sector is very important;
Enhanced continental cooperation on data collection and sharing is needed to support energy planning and stability;
A harmonized African energy transition plan is needed to prepare for the COP26 meetings in Glasgow, scheduled for 1-12 November 2021;
There is a need for additional dialogue and stronger advocacy to support the strategic energy interests of Africa.
The meeting was also attended by delegates from some OPEC Member Countries and non-OPEC oil-producing countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation.
In closing the videoconference, the OPEC Secretary General said: “Africa will continue to be an integral and essential player in the oil and gas industry’s long-term efforts to meet the rising energy needs of the world’s rapidly growing population.
“As energy stakeholders,” he said, “we must continue to dialogue and collaborate at all levels to achieve our common goals. In this regard, I invite all of our fellow African energy producers to join with us as we will only get stronger with the enhanced support and cooperation of our continental partners.”
The High-Level meeting was followed by the 1st Technical Meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue, which also took place by videoconference."

The 16th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) took place via teleconference on Tuesday, 27 April 2021, under the Chairmanship of HRH Prince Abdul Aziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Energy, and Co-Chair HE Alexander Novak, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.
The Meeting emphasized the ongoing positive contributions of the Declaration of Cooperation in supporting a rebalancing of the global oil market in line with the historic decisions taken at the 10th (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (ONOMM) on 12 April 2020 to adjust downwards overall crude oil production, and subsequent decisions.
The Meeting highlighted the continuing recovery in the global economy, supported by unprecedented levels of monetary and fiscal support, while noting that the recovery is expected to pick up speed in the second half of the year. The Ministerial Meeting emphasized, however, that COVID-19 cases are rising in a number of countries, despite the ongoing vaccination campaigns, and that the resurgence could hamper the economic and oil demand recovery.
The Meeting reviewed the monthly report prepared by the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), including the crude oil production data for March 2021, and welcomed the positive performance of the Participating Countries. Overall conformity to the production adjustments was 115% in March 2021, reinforcing the trend of high conformity by the Participating Countries.
The Meeting expressed its appreciation to the Participating Countries that performed beyond expectation in March 2021, with total overconformed volumes of 1.23 mb/d. However, some Participating Countries have yet to achieve the minimum expectation of 100% conformity and to compensate for overproduced volumes.
The Meeting further noted that DoC Participating Countries pledged to achieve full conformity and make up for previous adjustment shortfalls during the extended compensation period, which runs through the end of September 2021, and stressed the importance of accelerating the market rebalancing efforts without delay. It reminded all Participating Countries to remain vigilant and flexible given the uncertain market conditions.
The Meeting noted, with gratitude, the significant additional voluntary supply adjustment of 1 mb/d made by Saudi Arabia in April 2021 and a gradual return of these volumes in May, June and July 2021, given the prevailing uncertainties surrounding the pace of the oil demand recovery.
The Meeting observed the destocking trend of commercial OECD inventories, but noted that they increased by 14.4 mb in March 2021 and were 77.4 mb above the 2015-2019 average.
Under the referred circumstances, the Ministerial Meeting decided on the continued implementation of the production adjustment decision of the 15th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (in the months of June and July as per the attached table).
It was decided that the 30th JMMC Meeting and the 17th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting will take place on 1 June 2021.

The Ministers noted, with gratitude, the value of the prudent policy approach by Saudi Arabia of maintaining its additional voluntary adjustments of 1 mb/d in April 2021 for the third month in a row.
The Meeting approved the adjustment of the production levels for May, June and July 2021, while continuing to adhere to the mechanism agreed upon in the 12th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (December 2020) to hold monthly OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings to assess market conditions and decide on production level adjustments for the following month, with every adjustment being no more than 0.5 mb/d.
The Ministers reviewed the monthly report prepared by the Joint Technical Committee (JTC), including the crude oil production data for February.
They recognized the improvements in the market supported by global vaccination programmes and stimulus packages in key economies but noted that the volatility observed in recent weeks warrants a continued cautious and vigilant approach in monitoring market developments.
The Meeting observed that in February, oil stocks in OECD countries fell for the seventh consecutive month, but still remained above the 2015-2019 average.
The Meeting welcomed the positive performance of participating countries. Overall conformity reached 115 per cent in February 2021, reinforcing the trend of aggregate high conformity by participating countries.
The Ministers noted that since the April 2020 meeting, OPEC and non-OPEC Participating Countries in the DoC had contributed to adjusting downward global oil supply by 2.6 billion barrels of oil by the end of February 2021, which has accelerated the rebalancing of the oil market.
The Ministers expressed their thanks to those countries that have submitted plans for previous compensation shortfalls and continue to work towards compensating for overproduced volumes. They urged all participants to achieve full conformity to reach the objective of market rebalancing and avoid undue delay in the process.
In this regard, the Ministers agreed to the request by several countries that have not yet completed their compensation for an extension of the compensation period until the end of September 2021.
The Ministers agreed to that participating countries with outstanding overproduced volumes will submit their plans for implementation of any required compensation for overproduced volumes to the OPEC Secretariat by 15 April 2021.
The Meeting commended Saudi Arabia for its recently announced “Saudi Green Initiative” and “Middle East Green Initiative” as important contributions to global efforts to combat climate change, and welcomed Saudi Arabia’s commitment to transfer knowledge and share experiences as art of these initiatives.
The oil and gas industry can be part of the solution to climate change. OPEC possesses critical resources and expertise that can help meet the challenge of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.
The group will explore ways to enhance collaboration in this important area. G20 Leaders have already endorsed the strategy advanced by Saudi Arabia to deal with climate change – the Circular Carbon Economy and its 4Rs – reduce, reuse, recycle, and remove – as an inclusive and balanced solution for dealing with greenhouse gas emissions.
The Ministers thanked the JTC and the OPEC Secretariat for their contributions to the meeting. The next meetings of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) and OPEC and non-OPEC Ministers are scheduled for 28 April 2021."
2021-03-30,"OPEC welcomes Saudi Arabia’s new green initiatives
No 09/2021
Vienna, Austria
30 Mar 2021
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) welcomes two new initiatives by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which aim to reduce emissions and the region’s environmental footprint.
HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General, noted that the ‘Saudi Green Initiative’ and the ‘Middle East Green Initiative’ represent an important contribution to our global efforts to combat climate change.
“The recently announced initiatives are timely and form an important part of the Kingdom’s efforts to address environmental challenges and climate change. With these initiatives, the Kingdom continues to steer its global engagement on energy and environmental policies through the principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’,” the Secretary General said.
OPEC and its Member Countries, beyond their commitment to sustainable oil market stability, are closely associated with inclusive solutions to addressing issues of global concern, including sustainable development, environmental initiatives and climate change, and the eradication of energy poverty.
OPEC’s 13 Member Countries have all signed the Paris Agreement and most of them have ratified it. The Secretary General urged all Member Countries to ratify the Agreement before the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26), scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, from 1-12 November 2021. This would further demonstrate the Organization’s continued commitment to the environment and our quest for sustainable development.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s two initiatives were announced on 27 March by His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince. The Kingdom said it will work with regional partners, many of whom are OPEC Member Countries, to transfer knowledge and share experiences. 
The Kingdom, during its Presidency of the G20, promoted the circular carbon economy and its ‘4Rs’ – reduce, reuse, recycle and remove – as one of the inclusive and balanced solutions to the climate challenge, and embraced advanced technologies as part of the global energy agenda.
OPEC and the oil and gas industry must be part of the solution to climate change. They possess critical resources and expertise that can help unlock a global carbon-free future."

The 14th Meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC Ministers took place via video conference on Thursday March 4, 2021, under the Chairmanship of HRH Prince Abdul Aziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Energy, and Co-Chair HE Alexander Novak, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.
The Meeting welcomed the appointment of HE Dr. Mohammad Abdullatif Alfares, Minister of Oil, Minister of Higher Education, Chairman of the Board - Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), and the return of HE Mohamed Arkab, Minister of Energy and Mines of Algeria.
The Meeting emphasized the ongoing positive contributions of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) in supporting a rebalancing of the global oil market in line with the historic decisions taken at the 10th (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 12 April 2020 to adjust downwards overall crude oil production and subsequent decisions.
The Ministers noted, with gratitude, the significant voluntary extra supply reduction made by Saudi Arabia, which took effect on 1 February for two months, which supported the stability of the market.
The Ministers also commended Saudi Arabia for the extension of the additional voluntary adjustments of 1 mb/d for the month of April 2021, exemplifying its leadership, and demonstrating its flexible and pre-emptive approach.
The Ministers approved a continuation of the production levels of March for the month of April, with the exception of Russia and Kazakhstan, which will be allowed to increase production by 130 and 20 thousand barrels per day respectively, due to continued seasonal consumption patterns.
The Meeting reviewed the monthly report prepared by the Joint Technical Committee (JTC), including the crude oil production data for the month of February.
It welcomed the positive performance of participating countries. Overall conformity with the original decision was 103 per cent, reinforcing the trend of aggregate high conformity by participating countries.
The Meeting noted that since the April 2020 meeting, OPEC and non-OPEC countries had withheld 2.3bn barrels of oil by end of January 2021, accelerating the oil market rebalancing.
The Meeting extended special thanks to Nigeria for achieving full conformity in January 2021, and compensating its entire overproduced volumes.
The ministers thanked HE Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources of Nigeria, for his shuttle diplomacy as Special Envoy of the JMMC to Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and South Sudan to discuss matters pertaining to conformity levels with the voluntary production adjustments and compensation of over-produced volumes.
In this regards the Ministers agreed to the request by several countries, which have not yet completed their compensation, for an extension of the compensation period until end of July 2021.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has postponed its 8th International Seminar until next year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Seminar, originally scheduled for 16-17 June 2021, will now be held on 29-30 June 2022 at the Hofburg Imperial Palace in Vienna, Austria.
OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, said: “The OPEC International Seminar is regarded as one of the premier events on the world energy calendar and the decision to postpone follows very close consultations with many stakeholders, including our Member Countries. Though this was not an easy decision to make, our utmost priority is the safety and health of all participants. We look forward to building on our past achievements and holding an even more successful Seminar again in 2022. We thank the Hofburg Palace, the City of Vienna and the Austrian Government for their support and flexibility in facilitating this change.”
The Seminar’s participants customarily include Ministers from OPEC Member Countries, countries participating in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, and other oil-producing and oil-consuming nations; heads of international organizations; chief executives of national and international oil companies; along with other industry leaders, academics, analysts, energy experts and journalists from specialised media.
OPEC has held seminars since 1969 and the first in the current series of International Seminars took place in 2001. Over subsequent decades, the OPEC Seminar has increased in size and scope, covering topics such as the world economy, global finance, energy cooperation and the transition, sustainable development and the environment.
The Seminar’s reputation has grown steadily. The last edition in 2018 attracted a record of more than 950 participants from over 50 nations, around 80 speakers, 60 ministers and CEOs, 19 sponsors, 20 exhibitors, and 170 journalists, analysts and photographers.
The postponement comes as travel restrictions remain in place in many countries and lockdown measures complicate the logistics of planning major international events."
2021-02-17,"IEA-IEF-OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks discusses global energy security and market stability
No --
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
17 Feb 2021
[Joint Press Release] The International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Energy Forum (IEF) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) today hosted the 11th IEA-IEF-OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global energy markets and the outlook for global energy security and market stability.
Hosted by the IEF, the symposium reviewed the IEA’s and OPEC’s short-, medium- and longterm outlooks, which are analyzed in the newly released IEF-RFF Outlooks Comparison Report. Produced by the IEF and Resources For the Future (RFF), the report posted on the IEF website highlights a reset in energy outlooks after the biggest demand shock in history last year.
“The pandemic’s impact on energy demand is unparalleled in the history of energy markets,” says IEF Secretary General Joseph McMonigle. “The symposium explored what government policies and industry responses are necessary to safeguard the long-term stability of energy markets.”
Among the report’s major findings were that the pandemic led to oil demand contracting by 9-10 million barrels per day in 2020, but it is expected to rebound by 5-6 million barrels per day this year. The pandemic has also led to a downward revision in long-term annual economic growth by as much as 0.8 percentage points in some outlooks, the report noted.
The Symposium is part of a wider joint program of work by the three organizations originating from the 12th International Energy Forum held in Cancún, Mexico in March 2010. The Symposium was live-streamed and open to the public.
Dr Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the IEA, said: “Dialogue and cooperation will be increasingly vital to steer the global energy system towards a future that is fit for tomorrow’s generations, where energy is abundant, affordable, clean and is used to underpin growth and development.”
In his opening remarks to the Symposium, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General, recognized the vital contributions of the OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) in helping to stabilize the oil market over the past year, and the importance of close dialogue with the G20, the IEA and IEF in supporting market rebalancing efforts. He also emphasized the need for continued investment in the oil industry to ensure stability of supply and to help maintain an inclusive approach to addressing climate change, the energy transition and energy access challenges. ""These investments are essential for both producers and consumers,"" he said.
""In our fast-changing and unpredictable world, we seek to contribute to greater stability, more predictability and enhanced transparency,"" the OPEC Secretary General told the Symposium. ""We constantly seek to improve our capacity to do so, for we believe this will help us build a better future, one which serves the interests of generations of producers and consumers.""
Featured speakers at the Symposium included HRH Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, Minister of Energy of Saudi Arabia; Mr. McMonigle; Dr Birol; Mr. Barkindo; HE Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Steel, India; HE Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Nigeria; Yury Sentyurin, Secretary-General, Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF); Francesco La Camera, Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA); Vicki Hollub, CEO Occidental Petroleum; Felipe Bayón Pardo, CEO of Ecopetrol; and Spencer Dale, Group Chief Economist at BP.
GECF Secretary General Sentyurin, said: “Despite the pandemic, GECF Members have displayed outstanding discipline and resilience in the uninterrupted fulfilment of their obligations towards all contracting parties.”
“It is too early to write off hydrocarbons as they will remain the dominating source in the global energy mix for the foreseeable future,” he added.
Other key findings in the IEF-RFF Outlooks Comparison Report include:
Fossil fuels are expected to dominate the primary energy mix thru 2040, even in scenarios where countries meet the Paris Agreement’s climate goals.
The gap between current pathway scenarios and alternative scenarios is large and growing annually, signalling that the zero-carbon emissions scenario may not be achieved.
Demand for oil is expected to be stable over the long term globally, although demand will likely shift from developed to developing countries.
Differing outlooks on the expected importance of hydrocarbons suggest that new technologies such as carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) could have a bigger role to play.
Nuclear, hydro, wind and solar will account for a majority of growth in the electricity sector, while coal is expected to decline and natural gas faces an uncertain future as a transition fuel.
Growing climate ambitions in the lead up to COP26 will have significant implications for the energy sector, which accounts for three-quarters of global emissions."

At the 26th Meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) held on 3 February 2021, the Chair of the Committee, HRH Prince Abdul Aziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Energy, and Co-chair, HE Alexander Novak, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, commended the positive efforts of all countries participating in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ (DoC) for the monumental strides taken toward attaining full conformity with their voluntary adjustments in output. Participating Countries have been proactive and pre-emptive in measures taken to mitigate the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the oil market.
While progress has been achieved in introducing a greater degree of stability in the oil market since the historic decisions taken in April 2020, Participating Countries will not rest on their laurels. Sustainable oil market stability necessitates a continual renewal of effort, engagement and responsiveness to factors affecting the market.
In line with the principles of fairness, transparency and equity that underpin the DoC, the JMMC has mandated the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources of Nigeria, HE Timipre Sylva, to undertake a mission as Special Envoy to the following Participating Countries: Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and South Sudan.
The purpose of this mission is to hold consultations with the respective leaders of these countries on the DoC market rebalancing efforts. In particular, the Special Envoy will discuss matters pertaining to conformity levels with the voluntary production adjustments and explore how Participating Countries can collectively support and assist each other in achieving full conformity with their supply adjustments.
Minister Sylva will also discuss with relevant authorities the compensation mechanism in accommodating underperformed volumes as agreed at the June ministerial meetings, and later amended in September 2020.
Furthermore, this mission will solidify the dialogue channels between Participating Countries, and enhance transparency and information exchange. Given the geographic proximity of these countries, it is a rare opportunity for Ministers and leaders to safely meet in person, following months of virtual conferencing.
Nigeria is the largest producing country in Africa and a key member of the DoC. In 2021, Nigeria will mark the 50th Anniversary of its Membership of OPEC."

The Committee emphasized the ongoing positive contributions of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) in supporting a rebalancing of the global oil market in line with the historic decisions taken at the 10th (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 12 April 2020 to adjust downwards overall crude oil production, and the unanimous decisions taken at the 179th Meeting of the OPEC Conference and the 11th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 6 June 2020.
The Committee noted, with gratitude, the significant additional voluntary supply adjustment made by Saudi Arabia, taking effect on 1 February 2021 for two months, exemplifying its leadership, and the need for a flexible and pre-emptive approach by all DoC members.
The Committee reviewed the monthly report prepared by the Joint Technical Committee (JTC), including the crude oil production data for the month of December 2020. The Committee welcomed the positive performance of Participating Countries. Overall conformity with the original production adjustments was 101 per cent, reinforcing the trend of high compliance by Participating Countries.
The Committee noted that since the April 2020 Ministerial Meeting, OPEC and non-OPEC countries have adjusted oil production down by a cumulative 2.1 billion barrels, stabilizing the oil market and accelerating the rebalancing process.
The Committee further noted that DoC participants pledged to achieve full conformity and make up for previous compensation short-falls, and stressed the importance of accelerating market rebalancing without delay. The progress of Nigeria in this respect was well noted.
The Committee observed that in December 2020, stocks in OECD countries had fallen for the fifth consecutive month. The Committee observed that, while economic prospects and oil demand would remain uncertain in the coming months, the gradual rollout of vaccines around the world is a positive factor for the rest of the year, boosting the global economy and oil demand.
The Committee reminded all Participating Countries to remain vigilant and flexible given the uncertain market conditions, and to stay on the course, which has hitherto reaped rewards.
The Committee thanked the JTC and the OPEC Secretariat for their contributions to the meeting. The next meeting of the JMMC is scheduled for 3 March 2021."

The 13th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (ONOMM), held via videoconference, concluded on Tuesday, 5 January 2021.
The Meeting, which reconvened following an initial round of discussions on 4 January, reaffirmed the continued commitment of the participating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) to a stable market in the mutual interest of producing nations; the efficient, economic and secure supply to consumers; and a fair return on invested capital.
In addition, the Meeting recalled the decision taken by all DoC participating countries at the 10th (Extraordinary) ONOMM on 12 April 2020 to adjust downwards overall crude oil production, the unanimous decisions taken at the 11th ONOMM on 6 June 2020, and the outcomes of the 12th ONOMM on 3 December 2020.
The Meeting highlighted the unprecedented events of 2020 and shocking impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world economy and markets, and commended the DoC participating countries for undertaking the largest and longest crude oil production adjustments in history in response to the exceptional challenges and market conditions caused by the pandemic.
It pointed out that rising infections, the return of stricter lockdown measures and growing uncertainties have resulted in a more fragile economic recovery that is expected to carry over into 2021. The Meeting recognized that market sentiment has been buoyed recently by vaccine programmes and improved asset markets, but underscored the need for caution due to prevailing weak demand and poor refining margins, the high stock overhang and other underlying uncertainties.
The Meeting acknowledged the need to gradually return 2 mb/d to the market, with the pace being determined according to market conditions. It reconfirmed the decision made at the 12th ONOMM to increase production by 0.5 mb/d starting in January 2021, and adjusting the production reduction from 7.7 mb/d to 7.2 mb/d.
The adjustments to the production level for February and March 2021 will be implemented as per the distribution detailed in the attached table. Production adjustments for April and subsequent months will be decided during the monthly ONOMM following the criteria agreed upon in the 12th ONOMM.
The Meeting reiterated the need to continue closely monitoring market fundamentals, including non-DoC supply and its impact on the global oil balance and overall market stability.
The Meeting noted that high conformity levels have contributed significantly to market rebalancing and stability. Between May and November, participating OPEC and non-OPEC countries contributed to reducing the global supply by approximately 1.9 billion barrels, including voluntary adjustments, and this has been key to the rebalancing of the market.
The Meeting drew attention to the exceptional year of 2020 as an outlier that distorts the latest five-year average of OECD commercial oil stock levels. It recommended retaining the 2015-2019 average as a more representative metric, while keeping the latest five-year average for the time being. 
Furthermore, the Meeting expressed appreciation to participating countries, particularly the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Angola, which have performed beyond expectation. At the same time, it reiterated the critical importance of adhering to full conformity, and compensating the overproduced volumes in accordance with the statements of the 11th and 12th ONOMM, in order to achieve the objective of market rebalancing and avoid undue delay in the process.
It requested all underperforming participating countries to submit their plans for implementation of the required compensation for the overproduced volumes to the OPEC Secretariat by 15 January 2021.
The Meeting welcomed HE Dr Mohammad Alfares, Kuwait’s new Minister of Oil and Minister of Electricity and Water, and expressed its appreciation to his predecessor, Dr Khaled A. Al-Fadhel, for his dedication to the DoC process.
The Meeting decided to hold the next Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) Meeting on 3 February 2021, followed by a JMMC Meeting on 3 March 2021 and ONOMM on 4 March 2021."

The Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) between OPEC Member Countries and 10 non-OPEC oil-producing countries turned six today, 10 December 2022.
On this day in 2016, OPEC Member Countries and Azerbaijan; the Kingdom of Bahrain; Brunei Darussalam; Equatorial Guinea, which later joined OPEC; Kazakhstan; Malaysia; Mexico; the Sultanate of Oman; the Russian Federation; the Republic of Sudan; and the Republic of South Sudan, met at the OPEC Headquarters in Vienna, Austria, and decided to establish the DoC as a platform for cooperation and dialogue in the interest of oil market stability. Other producers attended the meeting in support of these extraordinary efforts.
The pivotal decisions taken at the inaugural OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting built on the successful ‘Algiers Accord’ signed in Algiers, Algeria, on 28 September 2016 at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference and the subsequent ‘Vienna Agreement’ decided on 30 November of the same year in Vienna, Austria, at the 171st Meeting of the OPEC Conference.
OPEC Secretary General, HE Haitham Al Ghais, said, “The Declaration of Cooperation is an unprecedented collaborative framework of 23 oil-producing countries that is based on trust, mutual respect and dialogue. Six years later, the framework continues to play an instrumental role in supporting market stability, which is essential for growth and development, as well as attracting the necessary investment to ensure energy security.”
The DoC aims to secure sustainable oil market stability through cooperation and dialogue, including at the research and technical levels, for the benefit of all producers, consumers and investors, as well as the global economy at large.
The commitment of the DoC participants to a stable oil market has once again been evident following the severe oil market contraction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts have supported the global pandemic recovery process, and have been recognized at the highest levels of government and by other international organizations and academia.

Abu Dhabi, UAE
31 Oct 2022
The 2022 OPEC World Oil Outlook (WOO) was today launched at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC) 2022 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). First published in 2007, the WOO offers a detailed review and assessment of the medium- and long-term prospects for the global oil and energy industries to 2045.
The 16th edition of the flagship publication incorporates analysis of the industry’s various internal and external linkages and its shifting dynamics that has seen a renewed focus over the past year of the interplay between energy affordability, energy security, and the need to reduce emissions. It provides insights into energy and oil demand, oil supply and refining, the global economy, policy and technology developments, demographic trends, environmental issues and sustainable development concerns.
OPEC’s Secretary General, HE Haitham Al Ghais, in launching the publication said: “The WOO 2022 once again underscores the increasingly complex nature of the global oil and energy industries. It is a challenging environment, and one that requires expert analysis to help us navigate both the challenges and opportunities ahead. The WOO provides this.”
He added that it was “a great honour to return to ADIPEC to launch this year’s WOO, an event that continues to go from strength-to strength. This is tribute to the leadership in the UAE.”
The WOO 2022 launch represents the culmination of months of planning, writing, review and production, and should be viewed as a helpful and insightful reference tool, one that underscores OPEC’s commitment to dialogue, knowledge-sharing and data transparency.
Highlights from this year’s WOO include:
The world economy is expected to more than double in size, and the global population rise by 1.6 billion between now and 2045.
  Global primary energy demand is forecast to continue growing in the medium- and long-term, increasing by a significant 23% in the period to 2045.
  The world needs to annually add on average 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent a day to 2045.
  All forms of energy will be needed to address future energy needs.
  Energy poverty remains an issue throughout the forecast period, with a wide gap remaining between developed and developing countries.
  Oil is expected to retain the largest share in the energy mix throughout the outlook period, accounting for almost a 29% share in 2045.
  Other Renewables – combining mainly solar, wind and geothermal energy – expand by 7.1% p.a. on average, significantly faster than any other source of energy.
  All major fuel types witness growth, with the exception of coal.
  Globally, oil demand is projected to increase from almost 97 million barrels a day (mb/d) in 2021 to around 110 mb/d in 2045.
  Non-OECD countries drive oil demand growth, expanding by close to 24 mb/d over the forecast period, whereas the OECD declines by over 10 mb/d between 2021 and 2045.
  India is set to be the largest contributor to incremental demand, adding around 6.3 mb/d to 2045.
  Oil demand in aviation leads the sectoral breakdown with growth of 4.1 mb/d from 2021 to 2045, given its slower initial recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. It is followed closely by road transportation and petrochemicals.
  Non-OPEC liquids supply expands in the medium-term to 71.4 mb/d by 2027, before an expected decline to 67.5 mb/d by 2045.
  OPEC liquids are set to grow to 42.4 mb/d by 2045, with its share of global supply rising from 33% in 2021 to 39% in 2045.
  Global refining capacity additions are projected at 15.5 mb/d between 2022 and 2045.
  Robust medium and long-term refinery capacity expansion in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, is partly offset by closures in developed regions.
  Strong demand growth is expected to lead to a tightening medium-term downstream market relative to 2021.
  The global oil sector will need cumulative investment of $12.1 trillion in the upstream, midstream and downstream through to 2045, equating to over $500 billion each year.
  Recent annual investment levels have been significantly below this, due to industry downturns, the pandemic, and the increasing focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues.
  Crude and condensate flows between the Middle East and Asia-Pacific remain the most important oil trade link, with volumes increasing from below 13.5 mb/d in 2021 to 19.5 mb/d in 2045.
  The Asia-Pacific region is forecast to remain the most important crude oil importing region throughout the forecast period, with imports rising by over 7.5 mb/d.
  Technological advancements are set to shape the global energy landscape while public policies relating to energy demand and supply are expected to become more stringent over the forecast period.
  Enhanced global cooperation could allow for a more coherent, balanced and integrated approach for realizing the Paris Agreement and the interlinked Sustainable Development Goals.

HE Al Ghais said: “The WOO is an indispensable reference tool that underscores the Organization’s commitment to impartial analysis, data transparency and the enhancement of dialogue and cooperation. This is extremely valuable given events in 2022, and the challenges and opportunities the energy industry will face in the years and decades ahead.” 
ADIPEC 2022, held under the Patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, is hosted by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC). This year’s event focuses on helping the energy industry tackle the dual challenge of meeting today’s growing energy needs with fewer emissions, and investing in the systems of tomorrow.

Vienna, Austria
10 Oct 2022
[Joint Communique] The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) held the third High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-GECF Energy Dialogue, on 10 October 2022, at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna, Austria.
The Meeting was co-chaired by HE Haitham Al Ghais, OPEC Secretary General and HE Eng. Mohamed Hamel, GECF Secretary General. It noted the progress that has been achieved since the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between OPEC and the GECF in October 2019. The two Organizations have intensified cooperation across a range of areas over the last three years, for example, both organizations now contribute to each other’s flagship publications — the World Oil Outlook (WOO) and Global Gas Outlook (GGO)— on a reciprocal basis.
“Our cooperation with the GECF is an utmost priority for OPEC. It is consistent with the ethos of all our energy dialogues, as all parties benefit from constructive dialogue, open and transparent use of data and the exchange of best-practices,” said HE Haitham Al Ghais in his opening address. HE Al Ghais added that “Meeting the world’s growing demand for energy; correcting public misperceptions about the oil and gas industry; reducing energy poverty: none of these issues can be tackled by any one organization acting on its own. They require cooperation, openness and dialogue.”
In his remarks, HE Eng. Hamel highlighted that “One of the key issues for the global oil and gas industry remains the underinvestment, which started in 2015.”  HE Eng. Hamel added that “Both our organizations also share a lot of ground on the environmental agenda”.
The Secretaries General emphasized that the oil and gas industry has an important role to play in a just and inclusive energy transition and support the need to reduce emissions, bolster efficiency and embrace innovation. Events in 2022 have underscored the importance of ensuring that there is an investment friendly climate for the industry.
The Meeting highlighted the importance of data and knowledge exchange, which contributes to improved accuracy of dataflow. Going forward, the two Organizations will intensify participation in yearly data and statistically focused meetings. They will continue to engage under the Joint Organizations Data Initiative (JODI).
The Meeting resolved to continue and strengthen cooperation; increase knowledge sharing by participating in each other’s events; and work together on environmental matters in the build-up to the 27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP27) to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.
OPEC and GECF have common Member Countries and common values. Algeria, Equatorial Guinea, IR Iran, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela are members of both. OPEC Member Countries Angola, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates are GECF Observers.
The leaders agreed to hold the next High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-GECF Energy Dialogue in 2023."

Vienna, Austria
28 Sep 2022
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) today marks the sixth anniversary of the adoption of the landmark ‘Algiers Accord’ on 28 September 2016 in Algiers, Algeria.
Six years ago, the OPEC Conference held its 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting in the Algerian capital to discuss oil market developments and deliberate ways to address the severe market imbalance. Among the key decisions taken was the establishment of a high-level committee mandated to develop a framework for consultations between OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries.
These pivotal decisions eventually led to the signing of the ‘Vienna Agreement’ at the 171st Meeting of the OPEC Conference on 30 November 2016 and the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ (DoC) between OPEC and non-OPEC participating countries on 10 December of the same year in Vienna, Austria.
In reflecting on the anniversary, HE Haitham Al Ghais, OPEC Secretary General, said: “The signing of the ‘Algiers Accord’ signifies an important moment in the history of the global oil industry, as it laid the foundation for what later became an unprecedented framework of cooperation between OPEC Member Countries and non-OPEC oil-producing countries, known as the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.
“Through our collective efforts, the 23 countries participating in the DoC have together supported oil market stability in the interest of all producers, consumers, investors and the global economy at large for almost six years. There is no doubt that we would be in a different situation if not for the pivotal decisions taken in Algiers in 2016,” the Secretary General added.
Earlier this month, the Organization marked the 62nd anniversary since its founding in 1960 in Baghdad, Iraq, by the five Founder Members: Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. OPEC is currently made up of 13 Member Countries."

Vienna, Austria
14 Sep 2022
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) marks the 62nd Anniversary of its founding.
Between 10-14 September 1960, OPEC’s five Founding Fathers – Dr Fuad Rouhani of Iran, Dr Tala’at al-Shaibani of Iraq, Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait, Abdullah Al-Tariki of Saudi Arabia and Dr Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo of Venezuela – descended on the Al-Shaab Hall in Baghdad to establish the Organization. OPEC’s creation marked the beginning of a new chapter in the oil industry.
OPEC’s five Founder Members joined efforts to safeguard their legitimate national interests. They called for cooperation, dialogue and mutual respect among all, as well as the need to address challenges in a collective manner and use oil to support national growth and development. The most vivid demonstration of that is the ongoing ‘Declaration of Cooperation (DoC)’ process, whereby OPEC works with 10 non-OPEC producing countries towards oil market stability.
The proactive and responsible decisions undertaken by DoC participants following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the severe contraction in oil demand serve as testament to the firm commitment to these principles.
In reflecting on this occasion, HE Haitham Al Ghais, OPEC Secretary General, said: “This ‘OPEC Day’ offers us an opportunity to reflect on our Organization’s history, celebrate our heritage and renew our commitment to the noble ideals upon which OPEC was founded. Honouring our past can serve as a guide and inspiration for achieving a bright and successful future.”
“On this occasion, I would like to send my best wishes and warmest congratulations to the entire OPEC Family; our Member Countries and staff at the OPEC Secretariat. I am confident that the Organization’s best days lie ahead of it,” the Secretary General added.
Cooperation and dialogue have been instrumental in OPEC’s work for more than six decades. They support its efforts in ensuring oil market stability in the interest of producers, consumers, investors and the global economy at large. These endeavours are also vital because of the wider societal benefits they provide."

The OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting noted the adverse impact of volatility and the decline in liquidity on the current oil market and the need to support the market’s stability and its efficient functioning.
The Meeting noted that higher volatility and increased uncertainties require the continuous assessment of market conditions and a readiness to make immediate adjustments to production in different forms, if needed, and that OPEC+ has the commitment, the flexibility, and the means within the existing mechanisms of the Declaration of Cooperation to deal with these challenges and provide guidance to the market.
The Meeting decided to:

 The 31st OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting was held via videoconference on 3 August 2022.
The Meeting noted the dynamic and rapidly evolving oil market fundamentals, necessitating continuous assessment of market conditions.
The Meeting noted that the severely limited availability of excess capacity necessitates utilizing it with great caution in response to severe supply disruptions.
The Meeting noted that chronic underinvestment in the oil sector has reduced excess capacities along the value chain (upstream/midstream/downstream).
The Meeting highlighted with particular concern that insufficient investment into the upstream sector will impact the availability of adequate supply in a timely manner to meet growing demand beyond 2023 from non-participating non-OPEC oil-producing countries, some OPEC Member Countries and participating non-OPEC oil-producing countries. 
It noted that preliminary data for OECD commercial oil stocks level stood at 2,712 mb in June 2022, which was 163 mb lower than the same time last year, and 236 mb below the 2015-2019 average, and that emergency oil stocks have reached their lowest levels in more than 30 years.
The Meeting also noted that Declaration of Cooperation conformity has averaged 130% since May 2020, supported by voluntary contributions of some participating countries. 
Emphasizing the value and importance of maintaining consensus as essential to the cohesion of OPEC and participating non-OPEC oil-producing countries, and in view of the latest oil market fundamentals, the Participating Countries decided to:
Reaffirm the decision of the 10th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 12 April 2020 and further endorsed in subsequent meetings including the 19th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on the 18 July 2021.
  Adjust upward the production level for OPEC and non-OPEC Participating Countries by 0.1 mb/d for the month of September 2022 as per the attached table. This adjustment does not affect the baselines decided on the above-mentioned Meeting on 18 July 2021.

His Excellency Haitham Al Ghais of Kuwait today took office as Secretary General of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at the Organization’s Secretariat in Vienna, Austria.
HE Al Ghais was appointed by acclamation for a three-year term at the Special Meeting of the OPEC Conference held on 3 January 2022.
He succeeds the late Secretary General of OPEC, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo.
HE Al Ghais said: “It is a great honour for me to be at the helm of an Organization that has been instrumental in supporting a stable and sustainable supply of oil to the world for more than 61 years.”
“Throughout its history, OPEC has been at the forefront of promoting dialogue, cooperation and partnerships to achieve its mission. Today, I look forward to working with all our Member Countries and our many partners around the world to ensure a sustainable and inclusive energy future which leaves no one behind,” the Secretary General added.
HE Al Ghais – a respected oil technocrat and well-known OPEC figure – brings a great wealth of experience from both his diplomatic background, as well as his extensive experience in the energy and oil sectors in both OPEC Founder Member Kuwait and internationally.
The Secretary General’s career in the global oil industry spans 30 years. He advised six Kuwaiti Oil Ministers on the global oil market and its developments over the past years.
HE Al Ghais is also a veteran of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC). He served at KPC’s offices in Kuwait; Beijing, China; and London. Before taking the position of OPEC Secretary General, he was the Deputy Managing Director for International Marketing at KPC.
HE Al Ghais was a leading member of Kuwait’s Delegation to the meetings of OPEC and the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) between OPEC Member Countries and non-OPEC oil-producing countries.
The Secretary General served as Kuwait’s Governor for OPEC from 2017 to 2021. He was also a Member of the Organization’s Internal Audit Committee, which he later skilfully chaired.
HE Al Ghais was the first Chairman of the DoC’s Joint Technical Committee (JTC) following the inception of the historic framework in December 2016. He led the Committee with great distinction in its first year, and subsequently served as a Member of the JTC until June 2021.

It is with immense sorrow and sadness that the OPEC Secretariat learnt of the passing of the OPEC Secretary General, His Excellency, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, in his home country of Nigeria. He was the much-loved leader of the OPEC Secretariat and his passing is a profound loss to the entire OPEC Family, the oil industry and the international community.
OPEC extends its deepest condolences to his family, friends, colleagues, loved ones and his home country, Nigeria. It is a day in which words are not enough, but it is also important to express our deep gratitude for the over 40 years of selfless service that HE Barkindo gave to OPEC. His dedication and leadership will inspire OPEC for many years and decades to come.
Throughout HE Barkindo’s long career, there have been several central themes that have driven him: an infectious passion for the petroleum industry; an unwavering belief in oil’s poverty eradicating potential; a steadfast commitment to sustainable development; the importance of dialogue and multilateralism; and, most fundamentally of all, treating everyone with respect and kindness.
As OPEC Secretary General, a position he assumed on August 1, 2016, HE Barkindo was a visionary leader and an eloquent communicator who played key role in forming the historic Declaration of Cooperation at the end of 2016. He served the Organization with great distinction and helped it successfully navigate through two major industry downturns (2015-2016 and 2020-2021), was instrumental in the setting up of the Charter of Cooperation (CoC), and was a consummate diplomat in further advancing dialogue and cooperation with a variety of industry stakeholders.
Despite the attainment of so many heights in his career, HE Barkindo remained a selfless man of great humility and decency; treating everyone, irrespective of rank or office, with dignity and courtesy. A trailblazer widely admired and respected throughout the globe. A dear friend to many.
To those who were fortunate enough to know and work alongside him, they will miss his warmth, kindness and sense of humour. His example of dedication and duty will inspire future leaders in the industry.
To the last, he was always true to his respectful nature, always there to listen, offer guidance and show leadership; a genuine OPEC icon. His last words to friends were that he was happy to have concluded his tenure as Secretary General, he had served the best he could, and that he was proud of those who had served with him.
HE Barkindo elevated the Organization’s position and role as an active and responsible partner in the oil industry and international community through both his deeds and words.  Given his scholarly nature, and the fact that his speeches regularly used quotes to emphasize points and opinions, it is perhaps apt to leave the final word to one of Barkindo’s favourite scribes, the famous poet, Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi. 
“Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes. Because for those who love with heart and soul there is no such thing as separation.”

“Mr Barkindo is a strong believer in multilateralism and cooperation,” Minister Sylva highlighted.
In return, the Secretary General said: “I and my colleagues from the OPEC Secretariat are deeply honoured by your audience, Mr President, as well as of the honourable Minister Sylva and other senior officials of the Nigerian oil and gas industry.”

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) today launched its flagship Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB) 2022. The event was held in a hybrid format.
Dr Ayed Al-Qahtani, Director of Research Division, in charge of the OPEC Secretariat, and Dr Jakob Müllner, Associate Professor and Academic Director at the WU Executive Academy, the sponsor of the launch, delivered remarks at the event. A broad range of industry stakeholders attended the event, which was livestreamed via the Organization’s website and YouTube account.
In its 57th edition, the ASB continues to provide an extensive range of statistical data on nearly all aspects of the oil and gas industry, ranging from exploration and production to refining and transportation.
The publication has become a highly relied-upon source for statistics on the oil and gas activities of OPEC’s 13 Member Countries: Algeria, Angola, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, IR Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. It also provides data for other producers by geographical region and covers the world’s major economic areas.
Dr Müllner, in his welcome address, said that it is “an honour for the WU Executive Academy to sponsor the launch of OPEC’s Annual Statistical Bulletin 2022,” adding, “We are happy to have such a positive relationship” with neighbouring institutions, such as OPEC. “OPEC has been a valuable partner for our activities in research and teaching,” he stated.
In his remarks, Dr Al-Qahtani highlighted that “the ASB, through more than five decades of being published, has become a highly sought-after and trusted resource for stakeholders across the industry.”
Dr Al-Qahtani noted that the publication’s readers have increasingly turned to the ASB as “a go-to reference tool for essential data on the global oil and gas industry,” adding, “What they glean from the pages of the ASB will help them both form their insights and inform their decisions.”
“OPEC is dedicated to enhancing data transparency through broad dissemination of accurate and timely oil and gas data, not only through the ASB, but through all of our publications. Indeed, maintaining transparency in all that we do underpins our core goal of establishing sustainable oil market stability,” Dr Al-Qahtani stated.
Following the opening remarks, a panel discussion with key OPEC experts was held focusing on the highlights of this year’s ASB, which included:
After witnessing an historical drop in 2020 after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, total world crude oil production increased in 2021 by 0.52 million barrels/day (mb/d) or 0.8 per cent, as compared to 2020, for an average of 69.64 mb/d. OPEC crude oil production rose year-on-year by 0.70 mb/d, or 2.7 per cent, while crude production by non-OPEC countries fell slightly by 0.18 mb/d, or 0.4 per cent.
  With an average of 96.92 mb/d in 2021, world oil demand rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic to grow by 5.74 mb/d y-o-y, or by 6.3 per cent. Although oil demand grew year-on-year in every region, the largest gains were recorded for OECD Americas, OECD Europe and China. Oil demand in OPEC Member Countries was bullish in 2021, gaining 5.3 per cent y-o-y. Distillates and gasoline accounted for around 55.2 per cent of 2021 world oil demand with an upward trend. Residual fuel oil requirements were about 6.6 per cent of total oil demand in 2021.
  World refinery capacity gained by 0.28 m barrels/calendar day (b/cd) to stand at 101.70 mb/cd during 2021. The non-OECD region, particularly the Middle East and China, as well as Africa and India recorded refining capacity additions. Refinery capacity in the OECD declined for the third consecutive year in 2021. Globally, refinery throughput increased by 5.1 per cent to reach 81.82 mb/d in 2021 amid bullish oil demand.
  OPEC Member Countries exported an average of 19.66 mb/d of crude oil in 2021, a slight decrease of about 0.04 mb/d, or 0.2 per cent, compared to 2020 and remaining below pre-pandemic levels. Following the pattern seen in previous years, the bulk of crude oil from OPEC Member Countries — 14.24 mb/d or 72.4 per cent — was exported to Asia. Considerable volumes of crude oil — about 3.27 mb/d — were also exported to Europe in 2021, compared with 3.13 mb/d recorded in 2020. OECD Americas imported 0.94 mb/d of crude oil from OPEC Member Countries, which was about 0.10 mb/d, or 11.5 per cent, above 2020 volumes. Exports of petroleum products from OPEC Member Countries averaged 4.03 mb/d during 2021, up by around 0.551 mb/d, or 15.8 per cent, compared to 2020. Imports of petroleum products by OPEC Member Countries averaged at 1.50 mb/d in 2021, roughly 0.015 mb/d, or 1.0 per cent, lower than in 2020.
  World proven crude oil reserves stood at 1,545 billion barrels (bn b) at the end of 2021, roughly at 2020 levels. Proven crude oil reserves in OPEC Member Countries declined marginally to 1,242 bn b at the end of 2021, following an increase during 2020. At the end of 2021, world proven natural gas reserves fell by 0.5 per cent to approximately 205.9 trillion standard cubic metres (tr s cu m). Proven natural gas reserves in OPEC Member Countries stood at 74.24 tr s cu m at the end of 2021, up 0.8 per cent from the level at the end of 2020.
  The OPEC Reference Basket averaged $69.89/b in nominal terms during 2021, up from $41.47/b in 2020, an increase of $28.42/b, or 68.5 per cent.

Baghdad, Iraq
19 Jun 2022
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Ministry of Oil of Iraq have launched a history book titled ‘OPEC 60 years and beyond: A story of courage, cooperation and commitment’ in Baghdad.
The launch took place in the Al-Shaab Hall in the Bab Al-Muaatham district of the Iraqi capital – the site of the Organization’s founding in September 1960. It was attended by several Iraqi Ministers, as well as senior officials from the Ministries of Oil and Culture.
The celebration’s agenda included various cultural activities, such as traditional music from OPEC Member Countries including Iraq. The programme also featured a show of traditional Iraqi costumes, which was presented by the Iraqi Al Aziaa House in Baghdad.
The publication was prepared by the OPEC Secretariat to commemorate the Organization’s 60th Anniversary. It aims to bring to a wider readership OPEC’s history, its objectives and achievements over its first six decades.
The book is divided into two sections: ‘Analyzing the 60 Years’ and ‘Cross Cutting Issues’. The first section conducts a thorough review of OPEC’s history, including key events that predated its establishment, while the second part explores important topics for the Organization’s mission and work, such as international dialogue and sustainable development.
At the launch, HE Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismaael, Iraq’s Minister of Oil and Head of its Delegation to OPEC, said: “It is a great privilege to launch the special book commissioned for the 60th Anniversary of OPEC’s founding. For Iraq, and the city of Baghdad in particular, we are delighted to be the site of the launch of this book.”
Minister Ismaael in his remarks recalled the founding of OPEC in September 1960 in Baghdad, highlighting that the Organization came into existence as a result of the vision of its Founder Members.
“The fact that our country is the birthplace of OPEC is an enormous source of pride for all Iraqis. We are proud of our role as a Founder Member; as a constructive force throughout the Organization’s history; a consensus forger and bridge builder,” the Minister stated, adding, “We are pleased that the Iraqi Government has sponsored this book and hope it will be a useful reference tool for future generations who seek to acquaint themselves better with our Organization.”
Referencing the publication, Minister Ismaael highlighted that “this book represents a singular accomplishment. It is meticulously researched, compellingly written and showcases the multitude of accomplishments that our Organization has achieved throughout its history.”
OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, also delivered brief remarks at the launch, in which he lauded the Organization for its many achievements over the last six decades.
“As an Organization we have come a long way, we have witnessed many ups and downs, we have seen seven major market cycles, including the latest in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have evolved as an integral part of the international energy community and we have seen reams of column inches written about OPEC,” Barkindo noted.
The Secretary General added: “It is important to stress that in terms of OPEC’s history, the Organization is far more than just an appendage to the history of oil. It is a story of a family of nations, of people and populations, of feelings and emotions of countries rich in culture and heritage, and of the struggle of a group of developing countries to exercise the inalienable right of all countries to exercise permanent sovereignty over their natural resources in the interest of their national development.
“The history of OPEC underscores the adversities the Organization has faced, the challenges overcome, the achievements made, and the value placed on dialogue and cooperation with other industry stakeholders, including both producers and consumers.”
The Secretary General also thanked all those that were involved in producing the publication, both at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna and in Iraq.
“We could not have done this without Iraq’s help. Your generous commitment to this project, your support for the anniversary celebration and your continued backing for OPEC, deserve a round of applause,” Barkindo added.
The Secretary General underscored that “surviving 60 years is a monumental achievement in and of itself for such an organization, but especially so for one representing one of the most volatile commodities – oil.”
At the launch, the Minister and the Secretary General both signed a copy of the book, announcing its launch.
The Organization was founded in Iraq on 10-14 September 1960 at the First Meeting of the OPEC Conference, which is widely known as the ‘Baghdad Conference’. In attendance were OPEC Founder Members: Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Today, the Organization has 13 Member Countries.
The launch took place on the sidelines of the sixth edition of Iraq Energy Forum."

OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, participated in the Sixth edition of Iraq Energy Forum in Baghdad, Iraq.
The event is planned for 18 to 20 June 2022 under the theme “Global Energy Security in Times of Conflict and Uncertain Economic Recovery.”
The Secretary General’s participation included delivering a keynote address at the Forum’s opening and taking part in a plenary session to discuss energy security and stability in the global oil market.
In his address, the Secretary General thanked the Organizers for the invitation to participate in the leading energy gathering, highlighting its timeliness and importance given recent industry developments.
“Since I attended the first iteration of this event in 2016, this Forum has gone from strength to strength to become an influential event, not only for Iraq, but for the entire Middle East region. It continues to attract leading energy figures from across the global industry,” Barkindo added.
“The unity, peace, stability, economic growth and prosperity of Iraq and its people is of a fundamental importance to OPEC,” the Secretary General stated.
Barkindo underscored the vital role that cooperation and multilateralism can play in the future of OPEC and the energy industry. He said that it is important to recognize there is no one-size-fits all pathway and we need to take an all-options approach, an all-solutions approach, and an all-technologies approach.
“At OPEC, we believe that multilateralism should be at the heart of our energy, climate and sustainable development future. OPEC and its Member Countries have been directly involved in the evolution of the multilateral UNFCCC, whose core elements, particularly equity, common-but-differentiated responsibilities and national circumstances, must remain central to all processes moving forward,” he stated.
The Secretary General added: “There is no doubt that the oil and gas industry can leverage its resources and expertise to help unlock a low-emissions future through its role as a powerful innovator in developing clean and more efficient technological solutions to help reduce emissions.”
Barkindo underlined the importance of sustainable investment in the oil industry to ensure that supply meets demand. He noted that a total investment of $11.8 trillion is required through 2045, referencing OPEC’s World Oil Outlook 2021.
Following the opening ceremony, the Organizers presented the Secretary General with the prestigious Iraq Energy Award from the Iraq Energy Institute in recognition of his many years of achievements and dedication to OPEC, its Member Countries and the global energy industry.
The Secretary General also participated in a plenary session titled ‘Global Energy Security and the Pursuit of Stable Markets’. It focused on recent energy market trends, OPEC’s role in energy security, prospects for the oil and gas industry, and the Declaration of Cooperation.
HE Ali Allawi, Iraq’s Deputy Prime Minister of Economic Affairs and Minister of Finance, was among the session’s participants.
In its sixth iteration, the Iraq Energy Forum, which is the country’s energy and economic flagship event, provided a platform for lively discussion and interactive exchange between a wide range of industry stakeholders.
The American University of Iraq in Baghdad (AUIB) has appointed the Secretary General as an Honorary Professor. AUIB is a co-organizer of the Iraq Energy Forum 2022, along with the Iraq Energy Institute and the Iraqi Government.
Iraq will also host the launch of OPEC’s history book titled “OPEC 60 years and beyond: A story of courage, cooperation and commitment” in the Al-Shaab Hall in Baghdad tomorrow, 19 June 2022. The Secretary General and Minister Ismaael will be present."

16 Jun 2022
OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, participated in a symposium organized by the University of Dundee and the Centre for Energy, Petroleum, Mineral Law and Policy (CEPMLP), together with White & Case LLP, in London, UK.
The Symposium was titled ‘Quo Vadis? – Oil and Gas in the 21st Century, Charting New Directions for the Oil and Gas Industry after COP26’.
In his remarks, the Secretary General underlined the importance and timeliness of the gathering given recent industry developments, and thanked Professor Peter Cameron, Director of CEPMLP, and all those involved for the invitation.
On the Symposium’s theme, Barkindo recalled recent events related to climate change discussions, including the Paris Agreement and the announcement of the Glasgow Climate Pact at COP26 last year, with the US back at the multilateral table.
“This was all encouraging [COP26], given the pressing need to reduce global emissions, alleviate energy poverty, counter the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and find a sustainable way forward that leaves no country, industry or peoples behind,” he added.
The Secretary General noted, however, that talks around energy, climate, and sustainable development continues to be extremely emotive and not as broad as one might hope. He stressed that the conversation must be global, inclusive, fair, scientific and based on facts, not emotions.
“The new parameters of the public discourse around the energy transition seem reduced to the question: are you for or against fossil fuels? It is perhaps the ultimate false dichotomy,” Barkindo stated, adding, “All voices need to be listened to. The challenges before us are enormous and complex.”
He said it requires a delicate balancing act, with comprehensive and sustainable solutions, and all voices at the table. He added: “We have been delivered a stark reminder of the recent strains and conflicts related to energy affordability, energy security, and the need to reduce emissions playing out in regions across the world at the end of 2021 and into 2022.”
“It is an energy sustainability trilemma, with each piece of the jigsaw having to fit together,” he underscored.
He also stressed the importance of investments going forward and the need for clarity from policymakers and industry stakeholders.
In this regard, he recalled the recent call from G7 Ministers of Climate, Energy and the Environment, for oil and gas producing countries, including reference to OPEC, to play a key role in ensuring stable and sustainable global energy supplies. From this perspective, he stated that at OPEC “this is what we do, day in, day out.”
At the same time, however, he highlighted that the G7 communique also committed the group of major industrialized consumer countries to end financing for most overseas fossil fuel projects by the end of 2022. In looking at these two statements, he said, “it is difficult to reconcile them.”
The University of Dundee also reappointed the Secretary General as Honorary Professor in the School of Social Sciences until May 2026. The reappointment was announced at the Symposium.
In a letter addressed to the Secretary General, the University said: “The School … would like to record its gratitude for the contribution you have made … and for your ongoing commitment to the School and the University.”"

16 Feb 2022
[Joint Press Release] The International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Energy Forum (IEF) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) today hosted the 12th IEA-IEF-OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks.
Held at the IEF Secretariat in Riyadh, the symposium reviewed the IEA’s and OPEC’s short-, medium- and long-term outlooks, which are compared in this year’s version of the IEF-RFF Outlooks Comparison Report.
“Energy market outlooks were for decades the preserve of a small group of experts. But today, they have become a critical component of our understanding of the future for our climate,” said IEF Secretary General Joseph McMonigle.
“Intensifying the open dialogue between producers and consumers, aligning outlooks and sharing perspectives, is vital to stabilizing global energy markets and supporting a just and orderly transition,” he added.
Projections based on today's policy settings from both the IEA and OPEC see global energy demand rising through 2045 for OPEC and 2050 for the IEA, the symposium heard.
Significant uncertainties remain regarding policy and technological development, which will play important roles in shaping the pace of demand growth as well as the composition of the fuel mix.
Dr Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the IEA, said: “Never has the dialogue between energy producers and consumers been more important than today. The energy sector faces a range of challenges related to security, affordability and sustainability – and we must navigate them together if we are to ensure success.”
Dr Ayed Al-Qahtani, Director of OPEC’s Research Division, delivered remarks on behalf of HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General.
Dr Al-Qahtani thanked the IEA and the IEF for the continuous, robust partnership, including today’s symposium, which has become an important gathering of leaders, ministers and industry experts on the global energy agenda.
“Our deep and meaningful collaboration affects all of the world’s citizenry, who rely on us to find solutions to the very substantial problems facing mankind today,” he stated, adding, “Today’s meeting has provided us with a very special arena to openly examine and compare our outlooks and learn from each other to enhance the producer-consumer dialogue on energy security and improve market transparency.”
“The IEA, IEF and OPEC are working together to achieve an orderly energy transition, along with a more secure and sustainable energy future. Our dialogue supports energy security, while addressing environmental protection and mitigation of climate change, and moving economic prosperity forward for all on this planet, including the most deprived.”
Several energy ministers participated in the symposium including HRH Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, Minister of Energy of Saudi Arabia; Virgil-Daniel Popescu, Minister of Energy of Romania; Diego Mesa, Minister of Mines and Energy of Colombia; and HE Bruno Jean-Richard Itoua, Minister of Hydrocarbons of Congo and President of the OPEC Conference.

In his welcoming remarks, HE Eng. Hamel noted that “since the previous high-level meeting held in Vienna on 10 October 2022, there have been many activities jointly undertaken, contributing positively to expanding our fruitful cooperation”. He stated: “It is of the utmost interest that the GECF and OPEC work hand in hand to face the challenges of the evolving energy landscape and seize the opportunities that lie ahead. We need to leverage our resources and expand our reach.""
HE Haitham Al Ghais stated: “OPEC remains fully committed to this cooperation with the GECF, and it will remain a high priority within the framework of our ongoing global energy dialogues. I believe that open and transparent dialogue with our industry partners is a win-win proposition as together we seek to address the complexities of the rapidly changing energy markets.”
The Meeting stressed the pivotal role of oil and natural gas in economic development and energy security. It emphasized that oil and gas currently represent 55% of the energy mix and it will maintain a majority share for decades to come. Moreover, oil and gas remain essential in meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 7 to ensure affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. This will require increased levels of investment in oil and natural gas.
Both leaders expressed their heartfelt congratulations to the United Arab Emirates, an OPEC and GECF member country, for the excellent organization of COP 28, the record participation, and the consensual and positive outcome.

The fact is, without adequate levels of investment, the future of our industry is in jeopardy. Part of this effort entails ensuring a balanced narrative on energy transitions and, when necessary, correcting misguided messages related to both hydrocarbon fuels and our industry.”
Additionally, the Meeting highlighted the importance of data accuracy and transparency as well as the exchange of knowledge and lessons learned. Both Organizations agreed to continue technical cooperation in these areas.

[Joint Press Release] The Meeting was co-chaired by HE Haitham Al Ghais, Secretary General of OPEC, and HE Hardeep Singh Puri, Honourable Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs of the Republic of India.
These open and candid discussions at the Meeting focused on key issues related to oil and energy markets with a specific emphasis on ensuring availability, affordability and sustainability, which are necessary in ensuring the stability of energy markets. The two sides discussed the short-, medium- and long-term outlooks for the industry and recognized the important role of India in global economic growth and energy demand.
The sides noted the World Oil Outlook 2023, which forecasted that India would be the fastest growing major developing economy, averaging long-term growth of 6.1% between 2022-2045 and to account for over 28% of incremental global energy demand during the same period. The sides also noted the need for continued cooperation and dialogue in the interest of both producers and consumers while also exploring further areas for future cooperation.
In his remarks, HE Al Ghais said: “The excellent state of the OPEC-India Dialogue also extends to the development of positive relationships between OPEC, its Member Countries and major Indian oil companies,” noting that “OPEC’s relationship with India has continued to go from strength to strength.” He appreciated India’s balanced, realistic and pragmatic approach towards energy issues.
“The relationship between India and OPEC will be pivotal in the years to come, as the world seeks to foster global energy security, deliver energy affordability and reduce emissions,” the Secretary General added.
HE Al Ghais also praised India’s G20 Presidency, the remarkable chandrayan mission, and highlighted its leadership role in addressing global issues of great importance. “India’s heading of the G20 was impressive, with India’s able leadership steering this year’s G20 discussions to a successful outcome, including on key energy issues,” the Secretary General stated.
HE Hardeep S. Puri highlighted that, as the third-largest energy consumer, crude oil importer and the fourth-largest global refiner, “close ties between India and OPEC are not only essential but also natural.” He added that as that as India remains on a trajectory of stable and robust economic growth, fostering “deeper collaboration for the mutual benefit of both parties has the potential to contribute significantly to the long-term prosperity and stability of the global oil markets.” In this context, he called on OPEC to continue playing its key role in “maintaining and ensuring market stability for the benefits of consumers, producers and global economy.”
The Meeting noted the remarkable progress achieved to date in the framework of the dialogue, including at the technical and research levels. Last month, experts from both OPEC and India met under the umbrella of the 5th Technical Meeting of the OPEC-India Energy Dialogue on 27 October 2023 via videoconference.

First published in 2007, the WOO offers a detailed review and assessment of the medium- and long-term prospects for the global oil and energy to 2045.
The 17th edition of the flagship publication takes on board recent energy and economic-related developments, particularly related to the shifting dynamics around net zero policies, with many populations questioning the targets and the benefits, policymakers reevaluating their approach to energy transition pathways and new technologies being developed and deployed. It also underscores the need to bring modern energy services to billions that continue to go without.
HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman, Minister of Energy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Chairman of the Board of Trustees at KAPSARC was the special guest of honour and delivered remarks at the opening of the launch.
In HRH’s remarksو HRH Prince Abdul Aziz welcomed all attendees to KAPSARC as the Chairman of its Board of Trustees, especially HE Hayan Abdulghani Abdulzahra Alsawad, Iraq’s Deputy Prime Minister for Energy Affairs and Minister of Oil.
HRH also thanked the attendees of MENA Climate Week 2023 for participating in this crucial event, noting that it endeavours to illustrate that we are taking a lead in this issue.
OPEC Secretary General, HE Haitham Al Ghais, said it was a great privilege to launch the publication in the presence of HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman and thanked Fahad Alajlan, President of KAPSARC, and his dedicated staff, for supporting with preparations for such an important OPEC event.
HE Al Ghais highlighted that the WOO 2023 provides a data-driven, fact-based outlook that emphasizes the realities we see before us. “The upshot is there is no credible way to address all the challenges before us without utilizing all available energy sources, all relevant technologies, and with energy market stability as a cornerstone for the huge investments required.”
“The WOO 2023 launch represents the culmination of many months of modelling, writing, review and production. It should be viewed as an insightful reference tool, one that underscores OPEC’s commitment to dialogue, knowledge-sharing and data transparency”, HE Al Ghais added.

2023-09-28,"Historic ‘Algiers Accord’ reaches seven years
No 16/2023
Vienna, Austria
28 Sep 2023
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) today marks the seventh anniversary since the adoption of the historic ‘Algiers Accord’.
Seven years ago, on 28 September, the OPEC Conference met in Algiers, Algeria, for its 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting to discuss developments in the global oil market and explore ways to address severe market imbalance. The Conference then decided to form a high-level committee with a mandate to develop a framework for consultations between OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries.
These historic decisions eventually led to the signing of the ‘Vienna Agreement’ at the 171st Meeting of the OPEC Conference on 30 November 2016 and the landmark ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ (DoC) between OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries on 10 December of the same year in Vienna, Austria.
In reflecting on the anniversary, HE Haitham Al Ghais, OPEC Secretary General, said: “OPEC Member Countries and non-OPEC oil-producing countries participating in the ‘DoC’ process have gone above and beyond to support stability in the global oil market in the interest of all producers and consumers, and the landmark ‘Algiers Accord’ laid the necessary foundation for these extraordinary efforts.”
OPEC also celebrated its 63rd Anniversary earlier this month."

No 14/2023
Vienna, Austria
14 Sep 2023
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) today turned 63.
Between 10-14 September 1960, representatives from five oil-producing countries – Dr Fuad Rouhani of Iran, Dr Tala’at al-Shaibani of Iraq, Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait, Abdullah Al-Tariki of Saudi Arabia and Dr Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo of Venezuela – gathered in the Al-Shaab Hall in Baghdad to found OPEC. This historic milestone marked the beginning of a new chapter in the oil industry.
The five Founder Members were soon joined by other oil-producing countries with mutual interests, such as supporting oil market stability and protecting the right of all countries to exercise permanent sovereignty over their natural resources in the interest of development.
For 63 years, OPEC has called for cooperation, dialogue and mutual respect among all, as well as the need to address challenges in a collective manner and use oil to support national growth and advancement. The most vivid demonstration of that is the ongoing ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process, whereby OPEC is cooperating with 10 non-OPEC producing countries to achieve stability in the global oil market.
In reflecting on this occasion, HE Haitham Al Ghais, OPEC Secretary General, said: “OPEC is a unique Organization that has stood the test of time. For more than six decades, OPEC has endeavoured to support oil market stability in the interest of all producers and consumers, as well as the global economy at large, despite the challenges that have faced our industry.”
“The history of OPEC is replete with many achievements. We are grateful for the support of our Member Countries and the entire OPEC Family. I am confident that the Organization’s best days lie ahead,” the Secretary General added.
The 63rd Anniversary of OPEC is being celebrated in Luanda, Angola, on the sidelines of the Angola Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition."
2023-09-14,"OPEC Statement on peak fossil fuel demand
No 15/2023
Vienna, Austria
14 Sep 2023
On the International Energy Agency’s recent Op-Ed published on 12 September 2023, asserting that fossil fuel demand would peak before 2030, OPEC notes that consistent and data-based forecasts do not support this assertion. 
It is an extremely risky and impractical narrative to dismiss fossil fuels, or to suggest that they are at the beginning of their end. In past decades, there were often calls of peak supply, and in more recent ones, peak demand, but evidently neither has materialized. The difference today, and what makes such predictions so dangerous, is that they are often accompanied by calls to stop investing in new oil and gas projects.
“Such narratives only set the global energy system up to fail spectacularly. It would lead to energy chaos on a potentially unprecedented scale, with dire consequences for economies and billions of people across the world,” says OPEC Secretary General, HE Haitham Al Ghais.
This thinking on fossil fuels is ideologically driven, rather than fact-based. It also does not take into account the technological progress the industry continues to make on solutions to help reduce emissions. Neither does it acknowledge that fossil fuels continue to make up over 80% of the global energy mix, the same as 30 years ago, or that the energy security they provide is vital.
Technological innovation is a key focus for OPEC, which is why Member Countries are investing heavily in hydrogen projects, carbon capture utilization and storage facilities, the circular carbon economy, and in renewables too. While some may suggest that a number of these oil-focused technologies are still immature, they ignore the fact that many technologies referenced in net-zero scenarios are at an immature, experimental or even theoretical stage.
In recent years, we have seen energy issues climb back to the top of the agenda for populations as many glimpse how experimental net zero policies and targets impact their lives. They have legitimate concerns. How much will they cost in their current form? What benefits will they bring? Will they work as hyped? Are there other options to help reduce emissions? And what will happen if these forecasts, policies and targets do not materialize?
Thankfully, there has been a reawakening across many societies of the need for energy security and economic development to go hand-in-hand with reducing emissions. In turn, this has led to a reevaluation by some policymakers on their approach to energy transition pathways.
“Cognizant of the challenge facing the world to eliminate energy poverty, meet rising energy demand, and ensure affordable energy while reducing emissions, OPEC does not dismiss any energy sources or technologies, and believes that all stakeholders should do the same and recognize short- and long-term energy realities,” says HE Al Ghais.
In the interests of contributing to future overall global energy stability, OPEC will continue to cooperate with all relevant stakeholders to foster dialogue, that includes the views of all peoples, so as to ensure inclusive and effective energy transitions moving forward."

The UAE is a recognised global leader in tackling the challenges related to energy, climate change and sustainable development. Not only in words, but also in its actions with major investments into the development and deployment of renewables and technologies focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Dr. Al Jaber is a well-respected and renowned global energy leader. As Chairman of Masdar and Group CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), he has guided Masdar into becoming a global leader in renewables and continues to lead ADNOC on an unprecedented decarbonisation path, with ADNOC today having some of the lowest emissions per barrel of oil produced globally.
His stellar knowledge and expertise gained from leading both groups should be viewed as a recipe for successfully enabling inclusive and fair discussions at COP28, with the UAE best suited to make it a COP of action and results.
Dr. Al Jaber’s deep understanding of the energy industry and his objectivity has been praised by global leaders, and we welcome his encouragement for a just energy transition that leaves no one behind.
OPEC believes that COP28 needs every voice at the table to achieve practical, pragmatic and realistic solutions. We wish the UAE and Dr. Al Jaber every success."

[Joint Conclusion] The Sixth High-level Meeting of the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue was held in Beijing, P.R. China, on 16 May 2023. The Meeting was co-chaired by HE Zhang Jianhua, Administrator of the National Energy Administration, the People’s Republic of China, and OPEC Secretary General, HE Haitham Al Ghais. The Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China to the UN and other International Organizations in Vienna, HE Li Song, delivered an opening speech via video.
In his remarks, HE Zhang Jianhua highlighted that China and OPEC are important strategic partners. Since the establishment of the dialogue mechanism between the two parties in 2005, communication on policy has been maintained through round-table meetings and high-level dialogues, and both parties have achieved positive results in helping jointly maintain stability of the global oil market as well as consolidating and expanding oil trade between China and OPEC Member Countries, which are both of common interest.
HE Haitham Al Ghais emphasized that OPEC attaches tremendous importance to its dialogue partnership with China and is determined to reinforce and strengthen it. He noted that the parties had established a balanced, pragmatic framework for cooperation, and developed an ongoing exchange of views at all levels on energy issues of common interest. The Secretary General provided an overview of OPEC’s ongoing activities, together with 10 non-OPEC producing countries, under the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ to support sustainable oil market stability, which benefits producers and consuming nations.
In the opening speech of HE Ambassador Li Song, he highly appreciated the stable cooperation and long-term communication between OPEC and China, which contribute positively to the global economy and energy security. The Ambassador envisaged that China's new phase of development would open up opportunities for OPEC and its Member Countries in terms of market access, energy transition and shared prosperity. Furthermore, he pledged that the Permanent Mission of China in Vienna would continue to serve as a vital bridge in facilitating cooperation between the two parties.
Experts from both sides exchanged perspectives on the oil market outlook in the short-, medium- and longer-term, and the ongoing “Declaration of Cooperation” process, addressing sustainable development, prospects for the energy transition and other topics of mutual interest.
Both parties are committed to strengthening cooperation going forward, particularly within the realm of information and data sharing, technological exchange and addressing issues related to the energy transition.

[Joint Press Release] The International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Energy Forum (IEF) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) held the 9th Joint IEA-IEF-OPEC Workshop on the Interactions between Physical and Financial Energy Markets.
The high-level meeting was chaired by Dr. Ayed S. Al-Qahtani, Director of OPEC’s Research Division, together with IEF Secretary General, HE Joseph McMonigle, and Ms. Toril Bosoni, Head of the IEA’s Oil Industry and Markets Division.
In pre-recorded welcoming remarks, OPEC Secretary General, HE Haitham Al Ghais, said: “What this past year has shown us is the need for the continued monitoring of factors driving volatility in energy-related financial markets, and how it can impact not only the short term, but the medium and long term too.”
He highlighted that, when required, OPEC Member Countries and their partners within the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ have “undertaken extraordinary efforts to stabilize the oil market in these extraordinary times, in the interests of producers, consumers, the oil industry and the wider global economy. This is on the physical side of the oil market. On the financial side, we have been observing an accelerated trend in speculative trading, with investors and other players trading futures and options at faster rates, sometimes severely impacting market liquidity and hindering price discovery mechanisms.”
In his opening remarks, the IEF Secretary General, HE McMonigle, told the workshop: “Both financial and physical markets continue to tighten. Rising inflation and underinvestment in physical supplies expose new vulnerabilities. Producers and consumers must have this in mind when engaging risk in investment or to understand the evolution of energy costs for consumers.”
Ms. Toril Bosoni of the IEA confirmed that volatility remains a risk for energy markets. The last three years have underlined the impact of supply and demand shocks as well as of financial markets for energy price movements. The broader consequences concern particularly inflation as well as investment to meet supply and respond to the energy transition. The IEA appreciates the depth and expertise shared by today’s speakers that brought substantial insight to the discussion.
Discussions during the workshop were structured into three sessions, grouped around the theme “Spot and paper markets: divergent trends amid low liquidity in futures markets.”
The first session was on the ‘Factors driving volatility in the energy-related financial markets'. This was followed by a second session which considered the ‘Impact of physical and paper oil interactions on market functioning and price discovery’. The third and final session covered ‘Ensuring adequate financing to sustain oil and gas developments’.
The Joint Workshop is a part of the trilateral work programme established by the three organizations and endorsed by energy ministers at the 12th International Energy Forum in Cancún, Mexico, in March 2010. Since then, the joint IEA-IEF-OPEC meetings covering the evolving inter-linkages between physical and financial energy markets have developed into a unique, high-level technical event that bring together a diverse range of market participants to discuss issues that are not addressed in other high-level fora.
To encourage open and informative discussion, the Joint Meeting was held under the Chatham House Rule.
At the conclusion of today’s meeting, the three organizers thanked participants for their engaging and frank discussions on such complex and evolving issues, and looked forward to convening the next Joint Workshop in 2024."

Cairo, Egypt
12 Feb 2023
[JOINT PRESS RELEASE] The 2nd High-level Meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue took place today, 12 February 2023, in Cairo involving leading energy partners from across the African continent.
In a follow-up to the highly successful inaugural Dialogue held on 2 June 2021, OPEC hosted the second meeting with the African Union, the African Petroleum Producers’ Organization (APPO) and the African Refiners and Distributors Association (ARDA) to conduct open and transparent discussions on key energy-related topics relevant to Africa and its energy industries.
In his opening remarks, OPEC Secretary General, HE Haitham Al Ghais, welcomed HE Dr Amani Abou-Zeid, Commissioner for Infrastructure and Energy of the African Union; HE Dr Omar Farouk Ibrahim, Secretary General of APPO; and HE Anibor Kragha, Executive Secretary of ARDA.
The OPEC Secretary General noted that these partner organizations have played a crucial role in supporting the Dialogue, which has proven to be a win-win initiative for all participating parties. “Excellencies, I want to thank you for your excellent leadership and staunch support for this important Dialogue. Your combined experience and knowledge of African energy affairs are highly valued, and we look forward to benefiting from your expert insights,” he said.
“The opportunities for the continent will be significant in the years ahead, but there will undoubtedly be a great number of challenges in store as this industry continues to evolve towards a lower-carbon future,” he stated. “This complex and double-sided reality is what makes global energy cooperation and events such as this one of dire importance.”
All parties had a chance to deliver introductory remarks. Discussions followed on topics that included energy investment and finance in Africa, the energy transition, energy poverty and the way forward for the OPEC-Africa Dialogue.
Dr Abou-Zeid highlighted the importance of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue, stressing that the continent will require all energy sources in the short-, medium- and long-term. The Commissioner additionally emphasized the need for Africa to build various capacities and to work toward the expansion of the African oil and gas domestic market, which shall promote local transformation of products for value addition while ensuring adequate trade among African countries. She also invited all parties, moving forward, for a concrete collaboration on the development of the Africa oil and gas domestic market, enhancement of reliable data on the energy sector for sound decision-making processes, and mobilization of Africa’s own energy resources and potentials as to put Africa directly on to innovative and low-carbon energy development pathways.
In his remarks, Dr Ibrahim thanked OPEC for the leadership role it has been playing in the Dialogue, and noted that for Africa the challenge of energy transition is a lot more daunting. He pointed out that a study conducted by APPO on the future of the oil and gas industry in Africa in light of the energy transition identified three imminent challenges that African oil and gas producing countries must address if they are not to lose the 125 billion barrels of crude oil and over 550 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves located in the continent. These are the challenges of funding, technology and markets.
Executive Secretary Kragha stated: “ARDA is committed to working with its key partners via this important OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue platform to engage all relevant parties to build on the positive outcomes of COP27 and align on actionable steps to deliver a unique, just, sustainable energy transition plan for the African downstream sector.” He also said that “ARDA Week will be held in Cape Town, South Africa, next month (13-17 March 2023) under the theme ""Balancing Energy Transition and Security for the African Downstream"" and will include not only an OPEC-Africa Dialogue, but also other key panels and sessions to encourage the development of a robust intra-Africa oil and gas industry.”
The OPEC Secretary General concluded the event by emphasizing that Africa, despite inevitable challenges that lie ahead, will continue to be a major player in the global market. He stressed that global energy cooperation must be enhanced going forward to adequately address common challenges.
The high-level meeting was followed by the 2nd Technical Meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue, which provided a valuable platform for the exchange of outlooks and information.
It was decided to hold the 3rd High-Level Meeting and 3rd Technical Meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue in the course of 2024."

[Joint Communique] The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) held the Fifth High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-GECF Energy Dialogue on Thursday, 10 October 2024, via videoconference.
The Meeting was co-chaired by HE Haitham Al Ghais, OPEC Secretary General, and HE Eng. Mohamed Hamel, GECF Secretary General.
In his remarks, HE Al Ghais highlighted the vital role that oil and gas play in supporting prosperity and progress for all humans, noting that petroleum and petroleum-derived products are essential for almost every aspect of life. “Life without oil and gas is unimaginable,” he stated.
HE Al Ghais pointed out that the combined share of oil and gas in the energy mix will remain above 53% in 2050, underscoring the critical need for adequate and timely investment to ensure that supply meets demand. “For oil alone, total investment requirements to 2050 are estimated at $17.4 trillion, or around $640 billion per year on average,” he added.
HE Al Ghais, in his remarks, also underlined the importance and value of the ongoing dialogue and collaboration between OPEC and the GECF. “These energy realities remind us why the work of our two organizations is so essential and why cooperation between us is so important,” he stated.
HE Eng. Mohamed Hamel emphasized the strong partnership between GECF and OPEC, which has been demonstrated through a series of collaborative initiatives. Both organizations have made significant strides in data exchange and joint participation in global energy forums. This partnership is vital in navigating the evolving energy landscape and addressing the complexities of today’s energy markets.
HE Eng. Mohamed Hamel also highlighted the enduring role of natural gas and oil in the future global energy mix. ""The GECF’s Global Gas Outlook projects that global primary energy demand will increase by 20%, with natural gas demand expected to rise by 34% by 2050,"" he stated. This underscores the continued importance of natural gas for sustainable development, energy access and sustainability.
He also underlined that “natural gas is more than just a fuel; it is an essential feedstock in the production of fertilisers and contributes to ensuring global food security.”
During the meeting, parties discussed issues related to sustainable development, energy poverty, clean cooking solutions, technology, investment, energy security, data transparency, and knowledge exchange. They discussed short to long term energy outlooks and the related uncertainties, challenges and opportunities, as well as the upcoming multilateral negotiations. 
The Meeting highlighted the significance of cooperation at the technical and research level, and noted the positive outcome of the Sixth Technical Meeting of the OPEC-GECF Energy Dialogue held on 3 October 2024.

No 16/2024
Vienna, Austria
28 Sep 2024
The historic Algiers Accord, signed by OPEC Member Countries in 2016 in Algiers, Algeria, reached eight years today.
On 28 September 2016, the OPEC Conference convened for its 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting in the Algerian capital to discuss the conditions of the global oil market and examine ways to address the severe market imbalance. The momentous meeting led to the adoption of the landmark ‘Algiers Accord’, as well as the establishment of a high-level committee mandated to develop a framework for consultations between OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries.
OPEC’s extraordinary efforts paved the way for the signing of the ‘Vienna Agreement’ at the 171st Meeting of the OPEC Conference on 30 November 2016. These landmark decisions led to the birth of the historic Declaration of Cooperation between OPEC and several non-OPEC oil-producing countries on 10 December of the same year with the objective to support oil market stability for the benefit of all industry stakeholders and the global economy at large.
HE Haitham Al Ghais, Secretary General of OPEC, said: “The Algiers Accord was an extraordinary moment in the history of the oil industry, as it did not only set the foundation for what later became a vital force for stability and balance in the global oil market – the landmark Declaration of Cooperation – but it also demonstrated OPEC’s sacrificing, responsible and inclusive approach that considers all stakeholders in the industry.”
“Looking back, the Declaration of Cooperation has supported stability in the global oil market, and by extension economic growth and development worldwide, despite the challenges encountered, such as the market downturn caused by the outbreak of COVID-19.”
Earlier this month, the Organization marked the 64th anniversary of its founding. OPEC was formed on 10-14 September 1960 in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad by its five Founder Members: Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. OPEC is currently made up of 12 Member Countries."

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) today turned 64, celebrating more than six decades of exceptional achievements and success.
Between 10-14 September 1960, representatives of five oil-producing countries – Dr Fuad Rouhani of Iran, Dr Tala’at al-Shaibani of Iraq, Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait, Abdullah Al-Tariki of Saudi Arabia and Dr Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo of Venezuela – descended on the Al-Shaab Hall in Baghdad to establish OPEC, marking the beginning of a new chapter in the global oil industry.
The vital mission of OPEC and its objectives propelled other oil-producing countries to join the Organization shortly thereafter. These included supporting oil market stability and protecting the right of all countries to exercise permanent sovereignty over their natural resources in the interest of development.
In its 64 years of existence, OPEC has championed cooperation and dialogue among all stakeholders to achieve stability in the global oil market, address challenges through inclusive and realistic approaches, and ensure oil continues to support the development of nations and prosperity of mankind. The most recent vivid demonstration of these efforts is the Declaration of Cooperation and the Charter of Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC countries.
In reflecting on the occasion, HE Haitham Al Ghais, OPEC Secretary General, said: “It is without a doubt that OPEC is the champion of the global oil market and international cooperation, as it continues, day in, day out, to focus on ensuring that the oil market is stable and balanced in the interest of all producers and consumers, as well as the global economy, despite the challenges that our industry faces.”
“As we celebrate today OPEC’s unparalleled history of success, I am confident that, with the continuous support of our OPEC Member Countries and the entire OPEC Family, the Organization is set to continue blossoming for years and decades to come,” the Secretary General added."

The OPEC+ countries, which previously announced additional voluntary cuts in April and November 2023, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, held a virtual meeting on September 5th, 2024, during which the eight member countries emphasized their collective resolve to ensure full compliance with the voluntary production adjustments. The group includes Iraq and Kazakhstan, who have overproduced since January 2024, but have strongly reaffirmed their commitment to the agreement and to their compensation schedules submitted to the OPEC Secretariat as agreed under the 53rd meeting of the JMMC on April 3rd 2024.
In August 2024, Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Algeria, and Oman, conducted two ministerial discussions with Iraq and Kazakhstan. Both countries were urged to achieve full conformity and compensate for the overproduced volumes since January 2024. Iraq and Kazakhstan committed to engage with secondary sources to outline their plans for production adjustments to achieve compliance and meet the compensation schedules they submitted to the OPEC Secretariat on August 22nd.
Iraq and Kazakhstan reinforced their commitment during the OPEC Secretary General’s visits in late August, conducted in coordination with Saudi Arabia's Minister of Energy and the Chairman of the OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings. During those visits, the OPEC Secretariat organized workshops with the secondary sources where both countries provided extensive details on the immediate and concrete measures they are implementing to achieve full conformity with the required production levels and to meet their compensation schedules for August and for September. These measures included advancing field maintenance plans and reducing production alongside with delaying and canceling spot sales for the month of August. Moreover, the countries committed to adjust compensation plans for any over produced volumes in August.
In recognition of this strengthened resolve and renewed firm commitment, the eight participating countries have agreed to extend their additional voluntary production cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day for two months until the end of November 2024, after which these cuts will be gradually phased out on a monthly basis starting December 1st, 2024, according to the attached schedule, with the flexibility to pause or reverse the adjustments as necessary. The overproducing countries also reconfirmed their commitment that the entire overproduced volume will be fully compensated for by September 2025."

During the dialogue, H.E. Mr. Babayev, COP29 President-Designate said that “Azerbaijan, like other countries rich in natural resources, should be at the forefront of addressing climate change. I am grateful for OPEC’s support for the COP29 Presidency’s plan to enhance ambition and enable action and for the opportunity to include all parties as we build fair and shared solutions. Success will require action from everyone, so we are intensifying our political engagements as we seek to go further and faster to invest today to save tomorrow.”
Following a productive exchange of views, both sides:
Agreed to cooperate with the aim of achieving successful ambitions and comprehensive outcomes at COP29.
  Emphasized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in climate action to advance the objectives, principles, and goals of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and its Paris Agreement, allowing each country to chart its own path based on its national circumstances and approaches through a variety of measures that they can contribute to.
  Share common concerns and aspirations regarding ambitious yet balanced and inclusive climate action that takes into account the principles of equity, and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of national circumstances.

Vienna, Austria
26 Mar 2024
[Joint Press Release] The International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Energy Forum (IEF) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) held the 10th Joint IEA-IEF-OPEC Workshop on the Interactions between Physical and Financial Energy Markets.
The high-level technical meeting was chaired by Dr. Ayed S. Al-Qahtani, Director of OPEC’s Research Division, together with Mr. Christof van Agt Ross, Director of the IEF’s Energy Dialogue, and Mr. Joel Couse, Special Advisor to the IEA.
Discussions during the workshop had three sessions. The first addressed the ‘Factors driving oil market volatility’. This was followed by a second session on ‘Evolving crude benchmarks, price formation and interaction with derivatives markets’. The third session covered ‘Ensuring adequate financing to sustain oil and gas developments’.
In his remarks, Dr. Al-Qahtani stated that “our latest World Oil Outlook puts cumulative oil-related investment requirements from now until 2045 at approximately $14 trillion, or around $610 billion on average per year. This massive spending will be required to meet global oil demand, which is expected to reach 116 mb/d by 2045. This must be an industry priority if we are to maintain security of supply and avoid unwanted volatility in the years ahead.” Dr. Al-Qahtani added that “we must continue to do everything we can to avoid volatility, and this includes speculative positioning, which can adversely impact the global oil market.”
The IEF’s Mr. van Agt Ross told the Workshop: “Though physical and financial energy market linkages are better understood and have become more transparent, they require constant analysis to support the stability of world energy markets in a rapidly changing world.”
Mr. Couse of the IEA noted that “the continuation of this regular event has contributed to a better understanding of price formation in oil markets, and energy markets generally. Today’s workshop demonstrates again the importance of the ongoing dialogue between OPEC, the IEF and the IEA on subjects of common interest to the three parties.”
The Joint Workshop is part of the trilateral work programme established by the three organizations and endorsed by energy ministers at the 12th International Energy Forum in Cancún, Mexico, in March 2010. Since then, the joint IEA-IEF-OPEC meetings covering the evolving inter-linkages between physical and financial energy markets have developed into a unique, high-level technical events that bring together a diverse range of market participants to discuss issues that are not addressed in other high-level fora."

[Joint Conclusion] The Seventh High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue was held today, 19 March 2024, at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna, Austria.
The Meeting was co-chaired by HE Haitham Al Ghais, Secretary General of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and HE Zhang Jianhua, Administrator of the National Energy Administration (NEA) of the People’s Republic of China. HE Li Song, Ambassador at the Permanent Mission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations and other International Organizations in Vienna, participated in the Meeting and delivered opening remarks.
In his remarks, HE Al Ghais highlighted the importance of the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue, noting that this framework for cooperation continues to go from strength to strength.
“Our regular exchanges of views – at all levels – on energy issues of common interest remain extremely valuable, contributing to stability in the oil market in the interests of producers, consumers and the global economy alike, and in helping meet the challenges we face in evolving a sustainable energy future for all,” the OPEC Secretary General added.
HE Al Ghais emphasized that “OPEC and its Member Countries will continue to provide the affordable energy that China needs to meet its rising energy demand, with our interconnectedness in the sphere of energy underlining the strength of our relationship.”
HE Administrator Zhang Jianhua pointed out that China has always regarded OPEC as an important force and partner in the global energy governance. As we speak, China's economy has enjoyed a stable and rapid growth. Going forward, China's energy demand will still maintain rigid growth. We will coordinate energy transformation and security, unswervingly follow the path of high-quality development that puts environment protection as one of priorities and features green and low-carbon, accelerate the construction of a new energy system, carry out all-round international cooperation on energy, and promote the establishment of a new model that is green, low-carbon and reciprocal. China will insist on establishing the new before abolishing the old, actively and steadily achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality. China is willing to work with OPEC and other international energy organizations to deeply participate in the reform of international energy governance and promote the establishment of a fair, just, balanced and inclusive global energy governance system.
HE Ambassador Li Song said that China is the world's second largest economy and the largest oil importer, while OPEC is the most important international organization in the oil field. Strengthening dialogue and exchange is in line with the strategic interests of both sides and is of great significance for jointly maintaining global energy security. China and OPEC member countries belong to the ""Global South"". China is willing to work with OPEC to speak out for the ""Global South"", actively support the agendas and initiatives in the energy sector that are conducive to promoting international development cooperation and benefiting developing countries, and actively promote the implementation of the three major Global Initiatives put forward by President Xi Jinping.
The Meeting commended the progress made in strengthening the cooperation between OPEC and the People's Republic of China through the framework of the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue. Parties also expressed their firm commitment to enhancing collaboration going forward, including at the technical and research levels.
Experts exchanged views on market outlooks, energy transitions and the importance of oil in securing a sustainable energy future.
The Eighth High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue is scheduled to take place next year."

Cairo, Egypt
19 Feb 2024
[Joint Press Release] The 2024 annual OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue was held today in Cairo where participants conducted open and transparent discussions on a wide array of key topics related to energy and oil, including energy security, risk of underinvestment, climate change and energy transitions.
In his remarks, HE Haitham Al Ghais, Secretary General of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, posited that “dialogue with Africa is a key pillar in OPEC’s global energy dialogue programme which includes many other key regions, countries, and international organizations,” adding, “We at OPEC firmly believe that cooperation and dialogue among all energy stakeholders are absolutely essential factors in effectively addressing our common energy challenges.”
HE Al Ghais noted that “in terms of climate change and energy transitions, developing countries around the world, including those in Africa, continue to balance priorities between the dire need to support the development of their national economies, while also adapting to ever-shifting dynamics related to climate change.”
Contributing to the dialogue HE Dr Amani Abou-Zeid, the African Union Commissioner for Energy, Infrastructure and Digitalization, stressed that “we always need to consider Africa’s context as analysis shows that the African Energy demand could increase by 30% - compared to 10% in global energy demand - by 2040. Access to reliable, affordable and clean energy in Africa remains the priority for the continent, calling for concessional finance and investments for more generation, production, interconnections, local transformation and domestic trading of our energy resources in consideration of the AFCFTA and that to close the energy poverty on the continent and promote growth and wellbeing.”
She further stated that “the African energy transition programme and the African Single Energy Market both championed by the African Union Commission set out the vision and the path for Africa-wide at accelerating access and the transition, making use of Africa’s huge and relatively untapped energy resources.”
Speaking for the African Petroleum Producers` Organization, APPO, Dr Omar Farouk Ibrahim stated that the 3rd High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue provided a platform for stakeholders to reaffirm their commitment to advancing the energy agenda in Africa and explore innovative solutions to overcome existing challenges. He emphasized the importance of fostering partnerships, leveraging technology, and mobilizing resources to accelerate progress towards achieving universal energy access and promoting inclusive growth across the continent. Dr Farouk updated the Meeting on the progress towards the establishment of the Africa Energy Bank (AEB), noting that the APPO Ministerial Council has approved the take-off of the Bank in the First half of 2024. The AEB aims to fill the gap arising from restrictions on funding oil and gas projects in Africa.
The APPO Secretary General remains optimistic about the transformative potential of collective action and collaboration in addressing energy poverty and advancing sustainable development in Africa.
Dr Abdul-Hamid Mustapha, President of the Africa Refineries and Distributors` Association, ARDA, congratulated OPEC for its continued leadership in promoting the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue and reiterated ARDA’s commitment to working with OPEC and other key partner organizations, like APPO and the African Union Commission, to deliver a robust, sustainable, intra-African oil and gas industry focused on delivering cleaner fuels and value-added petroleum products via a lower-carbon footprint.  Dr Abdul-Hamid also shared ARDA’s objective of developing a consolidated register of investable energy infrastructure projects that will be shared at the first-ever ARDA Investment Forum to be held during the 2024 ARDA Week in Cape Town from 22-26 April 2024.  HE Dr Abdul-Hamid also looks forward to working with APPO to support the successful take-off of the Africa Energy Bank (AEB) this year and to providing bankable downstream projects for this laudable AEB initiative in the drive to meet Africa’s growing petroleum products demand in a sustainable manner.
Their Excellences concluded the event by underscoring the key role that Africa is set to play in the energy industry, in general, and the oil industry, in particular, in the years and decades ahead. They also highlighted the importance and benefits of fostering the ongoing cooperation between OPEC and the African energy organizations, especially through the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue framework.
